But for a brief explanation, I will tell you several things.I usually defend the argument that code without unit tests is dead code. Because, when a developer adds a new feature to some code which is not covered by a unit test, it is prone to override existing business rules (which kills the code written before). Maybe it’s not exactly prone to it, but you can imagine what errors can occur when a complex project needs to be changed. Unit testing is the only way to protect your code against breaking changes.Every time we write an endpoint we need to be sure several things work correctly. The endpoint should return the data in the correct structure and handle the request correctly. We can test it manually, which is not preferable. So we write unit tests to ensure that our endpoints work correctly. There is also another way for testing endpoints known as automation tests, but that is not the subject of this post.It should be clear already, but just in case: we need to be sure our business logic works correctly.There are several cases to test repositories. Of course we don’t test the framework itself. But we do write unit tests to be sure that our specifications or relations have been implemented correctly.Now it’s time to show you how to test our controllers in spring boot. Let’s imagine we write an application which allows us to save users in a database. We define a user entity, a user service, and a controller.Note: The examples shown in this post are not for real production use architectureOur controller has a dependency on UserService but we aren’t interested in what service does right now.So now let’s write a unit test for our controller to be sure it works correctly.We mocked our service because we don’t need its implementation details. We just test our controller here. We use MockMvc here to test our controller and object mapper for serialization purposes.We setup our userService.Save() method to return the desired user object. We passed a request to our controller and after that we checked the returned data with the following line: andExpect(jsonPath(""$.name"").value(request.getName())) .We have also other methods to use. Here is the list of methods:When we run the test we see that it passes.Now we go to test our UserService. It is quite simple to test.We mock the repository and inject our mocks into UserService. Now when we run the test we’ll see that it passes.Now let’s add a business rule to UserService: let’s say the user must have an email address.We change our save method in UserService as below:When we run the test again, we’ll see a failed test.Before we fix it, let’s write a test that satisfies this business.We wrote a new test that specified that if we send a null email, it’ll throw NullPointerException.Let’s fix the failed test by adding an email to our request:Run both tests:Now we’ve come to testing repositories. We use an in memory h2 database with TestEntityManager.Our repository is defined as below:First configure h2db. Create the file name application.yaml in test -> resources path:And let’s first write a basic test for our repository: save a user and retrieve it:When we run it we’ll see bunch of console output, and also our test passes:Now let’s add another method to our repository for searching for a user via email:And write another test:When we take a look at the console after running the test, we'll see the SQL generated by hibernate:So far so good. We have covered the basics of unit testing with spring boot.Now you don’t have any excuses to not write unit tests! I hope it is clear to you to how to write unit tests for different kinds of purposes.----4We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/newsSr. Software Engineer @Trendyol & Software Development Enthusiast | Interested in Go&Java DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Scalability.

I first moved back to Los Angeles to join the world of venture capital in 2013, when the tech ecosystem in Southern California looked very different than it does today. Long time LA fund GRP Partners had just rebranded as Upfront Ventures, moving its office from Century City to Santa Monica. The biggest recent exits were for Cornerstone OnDemand, Riot Games, and Demand Media. GQ had recently named Abbot Kinney the coolest block in America, but the Snap-driven tech transformation of Venice was still in its infancy. Greater Southern California had a long history of building strong tech businesses, but still felt like it wasn’t living up to it’s full potential.Since then, Southern California has been on a roll. Major exits for companies like Oculus VR, BlackLine, and Lynda.com have shown that Southern California can build successful companies in diverse industries. Greg Bettinelli’s list of SoCal investors has exploded in length. And everybody in the Bay Area seems to be moving to SoCal, or at least talking about it. The trend continued with in 2018, in which Southern California saw a record number of unicorn financing rounds, several strong exits, and the emergence of what was arguably 2018’s hottest venture-backed company.According to CB Insights (plus two possible additions of Fair and Seismic right at the finish line of the year), seven companies joined the Unicorn club in Southern California in 2018. Perhaps what is most notable about these companies is their diversity in industries. For years, naysayers downplayed Los Angeles startups in particular as being too focused on consumer and media markets, and lacking expertise in enterprise software or deep tech. In 2018’s unicorn batch we see industries ranging from healthcare to law to HVAC — no media or CPG this year. Santa Monica is heavily represented on the list, but the surprise runner up city was Glendale, which counts both LegalZoom and ServiceTitan as residents. Already home to the edtech unicorn Age of Learning, Glendale has quietly emerged as a major center for tech hiring in Southern California, far away from the hype of Venice or the laboratories of La Jolla.By far the biggest news story of 2017 for the Southern California tech ecosystem was the IPO of Snap. In just a little over five years from launching, the company had managed to change the way that teens communicate, build a serious competitor to Facebook’s social media dominance (spurning acquisition offers in the process), and turn the neighborhood of Venice on its head as at spread into every square foot of available office space. Shortly after Snap went public, many LA tech watchers were left wondering, what’s next?Perhaps the theme of big SoCal exits in 2018 was perseverance. Santa Barbara-based Sonos finally went public in August, a full sixteen years after its founding. Carlsbad-based Luxtera announced a major acquisition by Cisco seventeen years after its founding. And Amazon acquired Santa Monica-based Ring, which Shark Tank investors publicly rejected on national television. These three exits showed that the vast majority of companies are not overnight successes, and they require time and patience to build in the face of constant detractors.Another major acquisition for 2018 was that of Irvine-based Cylance by BlackBerry for $1.4B. Over the past few years, Cylance has joined CrowdStrike in building a cluster of cybersecurity expertise in Irvine, and we are already beginning to see a new generation of companies emerging out of Cylance’s success, such as Obsidian Security. Meanwhile, CrowdStrike has had a banner year and is hot on IPO watch-lists for 2019.If Venice thought it would receive some respite from tech mania after the Snap IPO, it was sorely mistaken. Just a few months later, Travis VanderZanden released the first Bird Scooter onto the streets of Venice. Within a year, Bird would notch over 10 million rides, radically changing transportation in cities across the globe and setting a new benchmark for rapid growth. Wired Magazine even named 2018 the “Year of the Scooter”.In the process, the company raised over $400m from Sand Hill road heavyweights like Index, Sequoia, Accel, and CRV, as well as from almost every large SoCal-based firm: B Capital (where I work), Greycroft, Lead Edge, Upfront Ventures, Pritzker Group, and Sound Ventures, among others.Over the course of the year, Bird caused bikeshare company Lime to rapidly pivot into scooters and inspired a wave of copycats around the world. It drew Uber and Lyft into the market right in the middle of their IPO preparations. And it set off a wave of panic among municipal governments and regulators, who didn’t want to be caught flat footed in the face of a new technology on their streets.We are still in the early innings of the scooter game, but Bird’s rapidly expanding team has already shown it can continue to innovate rapidly, launching a GovTech platform and announcing an initiative to allow local operators to launching their own fleets. Time will tell how this market plays out, but Bird has been a clear proof point for Southern California’s ability to attract talent and capital to build world-changing businesses.2018 was a year in which the tech industry was placed in the spotlight for its negative effects on society, ranging from Amazon’s HQ2 tax credit grab to the scourge of fake news. Perhaps the most pressing local issue has been tech’s impact on housing. Amid the backdrop of a much larger Southern California housing crisis, the clustering of startups around Venice and Santa Monica and large tech companies in Playa Vista and Culver City has put extreme pressure on housing prices on the Westside, leading to increasing arguments about gentrification, displacement, and what it means to be a good corporate neighbor.I am a firm believer that the long-term health of Southern California’s technology sector depends on its ability to continue to expand outside of Venice and Santa Monica, where there is simply lack of affordable housing options for employees within reasonable commuting distance. Greycroft was a pioneer in opening an office in the Arts District well before there was a notable cluster of tech companies in Downtown Los Angeles. The move is beginning to pay off, as large tech companies like Spotify put down roots and a new cluster of startups including the likes of Hollar, HopSkipDrive, and ProducePay decide to make DTLA home. I’m also encouraged to see clusters of great startups emerging in regions such as the Valley (e.g. Floqast, Papaya) and the Gateway Cities (e.g. Cargomatic in Long Beach and Next Trucking in Lynwood), where the local expertise in transportation and logistics is beginning to spawn tech-enabled challengers to a staid industry.As we look to 2019 and the future, we need to make sure that we foster these budding communities and give the same level of support that has helped the Westside produce so many winning companies. As the past year has shown, the growth in Southern California’s tech ecosystem will come from across the region, in sectors that we might not have anticipated. SoCal has finally proven without a doubt that it can compete across every subsector of tech, and the future continues to look bright.----2VC at B CapitalMike Fernandez--Mike Fernandez--Mike FernandezinB Capital Group--1Mike FernandezinB Capital Group--Unbecoming--767Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--279Zulie RaneinThe Startup--423The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--347Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alex Mathers--227HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Worry not, in this guide I will help youCreating a repositoryLet’s start off by creating a github repository. On github web interface, find New button. From there, enter a new repository name and choose a license (e.g. MIT). Github does not have a default .gitignore for .net projects, so leave it empty for now.Starting up your projectNext thing we need to do is cloning the newly created repository. (You may use “git clone {repouri}”). First thing we need to do is creating a .gitignore for our project. The easyest way is just copying the file from another open source project (e.g. https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/blob/master/.gitignore)Now we can finally copy the library code to the repository. I prefer to put the source code in a “src” directory, but it’s entirely up to you.For an open source library, you should strongly consider adding SourceLink support https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink. This allows other developers to debug through your code.VersioningVersioning is very hard! If you are not fancy manually versioning each and every package, I suggest using automated tools for that. The best tool I’ve been working with is https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. This small command line tool parses the tags and branch information and is capable if incrementing the versions on it’s own! It requires zero configuration, but should you really need to adjust some values, you may place a config file to the root of your repository. In the next section, I will show you how to integrate this tool into CI/CD pipeline.CI/CD pipelineI personally think that the whole CI/CD process (outside of CI vendor-specific tasks) should be fully reproducible locally. Therefore, I recommend defining build steps using either Cake (https://github.com/cake-build/cake) Fake (https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE) or Nuke(https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke). I personally prefer Nuke, for it’s incredible integration with IDE and outstanding CLI tools. To get started with NUKE:After you go through the setup process, you should be able to see a new project appear in your solution. And it already has some steps defined for you!There is some customization required. You need to include the pack target for creating a nuget package and include reporting of test results. You may also want to create a target that combines the other targets in a pipeline to be called by the CI tool. A sample with those commands could be found in my repository here.Now, commit all the changes to source control and let’s add the Azure Pipelines integration.Add a badge to you github repo. From the build pipeline, hit the 3 dots menu and choose StatusBadge button.This will open a page with MD preset. Include this into your Readme.MD that can be found in the root of your repository.Publishing to nugetFirst, if you’ve done everything according to the samples provided, you can trigger the build on Azure DevOps and the resulting nuget packages will be available in the build artifactsDownload the package and go to nuget.org. Find the upload button and simply drag and drop the nupkg file. Your package will go through validation process, and after it finishes it should be available for download.
