Soon, we could have the ability to cure cancer, break the best encryptions and predict a hospital patientâ€™s stay with incredible accuracy thanks to the next frontier of technology. Scientists are encroaching upon a tool called quantum computing â€” a process they believe is possible but doesnâ€™t currently exist, and certainly not at scale.Today, traditional computing uses CPUs to process information in bits â€” binary ones and zeros. Bits exist in a single dimension, so solving a complicated problem with a traditional computer requires adding more bits to a computation. This binary, one-dimensional system means processing happens serially. Massive amounts of data, like healthcare information or social media ad targeting, require a significant amount of computations that are still limited by todayâ€™s system architectures.Quantum computing, however, redefines how we think about the physical world. Quantum physics grants the ability to exist in multiple states â€” a quantum bit can be both a zero and a one at the same time (i.e. a super position). These bits make computers astronomically faster by creating infinite dimensions to solve a problem, allowing users to process unimaginably large amounts of data.The ability of quantum neural networks to solve incredibly complex mathematical problems could have far reaching effects, both posing fundamental challenges and opportunities to how we currently transact through technology.Banks, healthcare providers and governments are entrusted with highly sensitive information, largely encrypted through a process called prime factorization. Because there isnâ€™t an algorithm to find prime factors, the only way to decrypt this information is through trial and error, making it a highly secure system. Quantum computing, however, could in theory find prime factors in a matter of seconds, jeopardizing the most secure systems in existence.While quantum computing could endanger the way information is secured today, it also could be used to find new encryption methods â€” ones that are less vulnerable to quantum computing systems. It also could create a vast competitive advantage for industries through modeling and predictive maintenance, vastly improving business outcomes. Quantum computing technologies could add infinite dimensions or data sets to predictive algorithms that already exist. This type of technology could be utilized, for example, by healthcare systems to create even more accurate models for how long patients will be in the hospital and necessary staffing levels.Though many believe quantum computing is possible, itâ€™s also somewhat theoretical. Commercial versions are starting to be announced by organizations such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM, but the technology is likely 10 years from democratization, adoption and integration into productions systems. One significant challenge with quantum computing is the more dimensions added to a system, the more complicated tracing and debugging becomes, making proper implementation complicated, time consuming and expensive.As quantum computing moves towards immediate future, companies should be taking steps to prepare for both the challenges and opportunities that will come with the technology. When science advances to the point of quantum computing, the way the world regards computer systems will be forever changed, with material impacts on the way we treat disease, keep our information secure and conduct all forms of business.Brandon Ebken focuses on strategic delivery efforts and new technology initiatives in his role as director of Digital Innovation national services for Insight Enterprisesâ€™ Digital Innovation team.

CookFollow--ListenShareIn his latest video, wermy, AKA sudomod, was asked to help with a Harry Potter trivia tournament. While they wanted a buzzer system to determine which player had an answer, he wasnâ€™t content with simple buttons for this magical event, and instead made wizardly interface devices in the form of wands.Inside each rather thick wand, wermy embedded an nRF24L01 transceiver module, along with a battery, a LiPo charger, an Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 Express, and an MP-6500 inertial measurement unit. When a player â€œbuzzesâ€ in by flicking the wand, a signal is sent to a base unit that runs on an Adafruit Feather 32u4 Basic Proto board with another nRF24L01 module. This emits a spell sound, and activates a strip of LEDs that zip from one player to another. LEDs are placed behind a dark castle-themed cloth, which provides an excellent diffuser, and largely conceals the electronics, allowing people to instead focus on the quiz and spell effect.In addition to the wands, a host remote also interfaces with the base unit, enabling the person running the event to pause the game, signal that a question is ready, and input that a correct or incorrect response has been entered. This device runs on an Adafruit Feather M0 Express, and contains yet another nRF24L01. As seen in the video below, itâ€™s a fun setup, and from a technical standpoint, itâ€™s a great illustration of how several wireless transceiver modules can be used together for multi-node control.----Engineer, tech writer, content creator, maker of random contraptions for fun and profit.Jeremy S.

Technology has redefines sensitive aspect of the education sector and no one knows what is next in stock.Talking about undergraduate project research now, technology has redefined how it is done; certainly, as new technologies emerge, the society and everything that influences it tilt forward to flow with the new cycle. To this point, it has not just influenced teaching and learning processes, it also redefined how resource materials are retrieved, stored, recycled and beneficial financially. Maybe we should talk discuss it individually right?ResearchLong gone are the days of sitting in the library for God-knows-how-long, flipping through pages of papers and probably end up with nothing meaningful. That doesnâ€™t mean that search engines are taking over physical libraries totally, itâ€™s just that it has diversified and as such modified how and where undergraduate students search out resource materials for their undergraduate project.Storage and retrievalThere has never been a better and safer place to store studentsâ€™ undergraduate project. What was obtainable was piling up projects and burning them after few years or months atleast. Google drive is available for saving digital projects, email too, cloud, flash drive and other advanced saving devices. The sweet part is that it is durable and portable no matter how many.RecyclingBecause research projects is now durable, it can be recycled; how? Well, if I may ask, what exactly do you do when you search for undergraduate projects and research materials online? If these resource materials are not recycled, you wouldnâ€™t have them there; maybe you would be cuing up in your lecturerâ€™s office by now, begging to have your project fixed.Without mincing words, technology has been the change that education has become and I suppose that more is yet to come.----uniprojectmaterials uniprojectmaterials--uniprojectmaterials uniprojectmaterials--uniprojectmaterials uniprojectmaterials--uniprojectmaterials uniprojectmaterials--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Technology is now a tool for empowerment, including people with disabilities. It has advanced to break the bounds of disability into inclusion through accessible and assistive features.

Good Vibes send and receive messages in Morse Code which converts vibrations into text or voice and vice versa. Morse Code letters are a combination of dots and dashes. The deafblind person forms a message by inputting short taps (dots) and long presses (dashes). People with sight and hearing can input a message as text or voice which the deafblind person will receive the message as a combination of short and long vibrations.Watch the ad for Good Vibes here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9djutxpXaQEMicrosoftAs a pioneer in technology, Microsoft aims to embrace everyone, no matter what gender you are, age, or disability you have.

OK, maybe not the walking dead exactly, however, if youâ€™ve walked down a street in any major city at lunchtime, you will know how difficult it is to cut a straight line between point A and point B without dodging people distracted by a phone. Catching up on messages, making plans or checking the latest news, ignoring all others around them.Online shopping delivered to your door at a time you choose? Yes, please!Talk to your family on the other side of the world, without paying a cent? Absolutely amazing!Pay bills, book plane tickets or build a website on your lunch break (or letâ€™s be honest, whenever no-oneâ€™s looking..)? Essential.However, there are moments in your life when the best way to get your point across, lead others, or get the job done is to speak with people.Warren Buffett agrees. Youâ€™ll often find him quoted on the value of public speaking, and as he is the third wealthiest person on the planet (at the time of publication), he is considered an authority in investment. When it comes to investing in yourself he places an exact value.â€œThe one easy way to become worth 50 percent more than you are now â€” at least â€” is to hone your communication skillsâ€ â€” Warren BuffetThe ability to educate, inform and inspire is prized in the age of information. Knowledge, and the ability to communicate knowledge, in a rapidly changing and shifting world is a new form of currency.Rather than thinking about public speaking as a stand-up-on-a-stage activity, it can be useful to think of public speaking as, well, speaking in public. This includes your communication skills when youâ€™re speaking online or in-person.Paediatricians, neuroscientists and prestigious professors have been studying the effect of technology on our communication skills and have found social skills, conversation and mental health all adversely affected by increased use of technology and social media. The constant distraction of technology is dulling our social skills and our ability to read emotions in others.On the flip-side lies the argument that technology can enhance our communication, by honing our skills in a variety of settings. We can connect people on video over great distances for free or next to nothing, leading to collaborations and diversity of thought that were not possible before. Itâ€™s hard to remember what it was like making a call from a phone booth or sending a postcard â€” if youâ€™ve lived through that time at all. You know technology is the new normal when your parents want to know if itâ€™s better to call you on FaceTime, Skype or WhatsApp?These arguments will no doubt carry on and mature as we begin to understand the longer term effects of how we are interacting, consuming and learning through technology.Wherever you sit on that argument clear communication is still vitally important, whether it occurs online or face-to-face (sometimes known as â€œofflineâ€ â€” ergh). So, unless youâ€™re considering a life of solitude on a mountain-top.. (no, wait, there are even blogging monks now) there will always be circumstances where you will need to stand up, and speak up.Wherever you are in your life right now Iâ€™m sure there are times you remember where you didnâ€™t speak, but wanted to. There are undoubtedly times that you spoke, but the right words only came to you after the heat of the moment.Whether youâ€™re in school, going for a job interview, interacting with friends and family, trying to sell an idea or product or leading a team, it makes sense to prepare for important moments where you want to have the right words, spoken in the right way, at the right time.It is not enough to simply read about training for a marathon, you need to run! Communication skills are like other skills in life. You have to practice them to get better.There is no such thing as a â€œperfectâ€ speaker, or one singular way to get your message across. There is a long list of things that people donâ€™t necessarily love, though, and it pays to understand the fundamental building blocks of good communication and public speaking.Culture can play a big part in what is considered polite or, to use eye contact as an example, assertive vs aggressive communication. Do your homework when it comes to potential employers, clients and even new friends from around the world.Practice, build your skills over time and put yourself in situations where you can â€œstretchâ€ new techniques and try them out for size. Ask to run the next meeting in the office, volunteer to speak at an upcoming conference, or record and review speeches before you make them.Gain feedback and self-assess where your development areas lie and create a feedback loop where you can quickly determine what you want to change and address the skills that need the most attention. Get ready for the worst possible questions the audience could throw at you, and be happy when itâ€™s really not that bad.Whether you plan to educate, inform or inspire your audience, you can gauge whether you are communicating effectively when you see the reaction from those around you. After you talk, stop to look and really listen.

Physical stores themselves, however, arenâ€™t the only aspects of retail undergoing change. As stores change, shopping habits shift, and technology evolves, the role of the retailer worker is changing as well. And while technology in some instances is displacing workers from physical retail, shifting the roles and responsibilities of retail workers, or augmenting the way they work, humans still play an essential role in the day-to-day operations of retail â€” physical or otherwise (at least for the time being). So, how are the roles of retailers shifting as the industry shifts? What pressures do current retail employees face? How are companies finding new value and opportunities to leverage the human aspect of retail that only retail associates can provide?As it turns out, several companies are already considering these questions. Hereâ€™s a little bit more about the circumstances they face.So how does change in the retail industry affect the workers making it happen on the retail floor? As it turns out, the change affects retail workers in a variety of ways â€” some good, some bad, and some in ways that are too early to say one way or another. In most cases, change is a mixed bag. Advances in technology, for instance, donâ€™t always make things better (as weâ€™ve written about before). And, in the case of retail, new pressures to deliver more value at less cost donâ€™t necessarily benefit workers either. As big-box brick-and-mortar retailers struggle to compete with Amazon and other eCommerce companies, workers on the retail floors oftentimes feel the pinch more than anyone.In a recent interview with Business Insider, several Target employees commented that Targetâ€™s efforts to â€œmodernizeâ€ have increased the amount of stress that workers experience on the job. These initiatives included eliminating backroom and overnight shifts and have led to alterations in the stocking process. Even though Target reportedly consulted every one of its associates before rolling out modernization changes, employees are still finding change difficult to cope with. Regardless of how you approach it, change will always present a challenge and, in most cases, some pain to go along with it.The story doesnâ€™t seem much different at Loweâ€™s either. According to Business Insider, the company attempted to cut costs recently by outsourcing or eliminating certain in-store roles and by downgrading several salaried positions to part-time status. In a recent interview with Modern Retail, a former Loweâ€™s manager reported putting in as many as 70 hours a week following the adoption of cost-cutting changes at Loweâ€™s. As the manager explained, the amount of work and changes drove them to the point where they thought, â€œthis was horrible â€” it got to the point where I felt bad hiring people.â€ Needless to say, a report like that doesnâ€™t bode well for the companyâ€™s remaining 300,000 retail associates.And, of course, you canâ€™t discuss change in the retail sector without covering the increasing automation. At Walmart, for instance, the recent introduction of Bossa Nova robots to scan shelves and clean floors for employees hasnâ€™t necessarily led to greater overall employee satisfaction. Although Walmart likely intended for the robots to improve the jobs of retail floor employees, several employees reported to The Washington Post that the robots made them feel less valued by the company. Although the robots have perhaps lightened the workload of employees in some areas, theyâ€™ve caused a general sense of monotony on the job to increase.And while some changes in retail seem to limit and stress the power of human capital, other innovations in technology are expanding the value that in-store retail associates have to offer â€” even to customers shopping online.Not all industry changes spell disaster for retail associates. In a recent partnership, retail tech company Hero and luxury fashion retailer Harvey Nichols found a way to use technology to leverage the person-to-person connection that only human retail workers can offer. Through their partnership, the two companies found a way to use live-stream technology to connect retail associates with customers shopping online. Using their smartphones, customers can video chat with in-store employees from the comfort of anywhere they choose. As a far cry from chatbots and call centers, video-stream technology allows for a genuine connection that could before only be found from in-store interactions between associates and customers. Thanks to new technology, the power of human connection â€” the crowning strength of brick-and-mortar retail â€” can reach much further than ever before.While live-stream represents one way retailers are leveraging the advantages of retail associates, technology isnâ€™t the only way to unlock the power of human potential in brick-and-mortar spaces. As retail changes, certain skills become more and more necessary to meet modern demands. In many cases, meeting the expectations of customers in todayâ€™s retail climate could mean simply providing more in-depth training for new and existing employees.According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), the retail industry of today requires skills that even a decade ago werenâ€™t as much of a priority. As NRF reports, â€œThe role (of the retail associate) is less about folding sweaters as it is about selling them, and retailers are looking more and more for people to come into the role with the skills to sell.â€With retailers seeking increasingly skilled (and educated) employees, skills in communication, sales, writing, math, teamwork, time-management, customer service, and merchandising have all increased in their value and demand. In todayâ€™s retail climate, these skills arenâ€™t just nice to have. Rather, they can make all the difference for retailers in their ability to create a satisfying customer experience. As brick-and-mortar retailers struggle to find their place and remain relevant in the modern market, that ability, more than anything, is priceless.With skilled employees proving more necessary than ever, retailers looking to create satisfying customer experiences and cut costs might actually accomplish these goals best by investing in employee training, which incentivizes employees to remain with their employer and makes employees feel more valued. In the end, the break from the everyday monotony and the skills provided through training could lead to more confidence and engagement on the job, greater efficiency with employee time, and less turnover in the long run. In the end, training provides a low-tech fix with the potential to reduce cost and turnover while increasing customer satisfaction along the way. Customers who feel satisfied with their in-store experiences, of course, are customers who are likely to return.With retail changing in about every way possible, what can retailers do to evolve in a way that allows them to face new challenges and capitalize on rising opportunities?

At the same time, they are also fighting malicious and deliberate attempts to breach their information systems. No enterprise is immune to hackers, and how they address this growing need will have a significant impact on their company. Former Cisco CEO John Chambers once said, â€œThere are two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those who donâ€™t yet know they have been hacked.â€Security continues to be a growing concern for businesses across industries. Given the huge amount of private information at stake, businesses need to implement layered cybersecurity architecture to defend their operations.Outside Threat ProtectionAs shown in the diagram, there are 5 layers of security: Perimeter, Network, Endpoint, Application, and Data. Enterprises typically apply best of breed security products to help them protect these 5 primary layers. Notable players at each layer include:Because of limited budgets and shortage of in-house security professionals, SMBs generally outsource cyber defense to MSSPs (managed security service providers), who supply a mix of security consulting services, ongoing monthly maintenance services, and product sales (often sourced from best-of-breed security vendors for each layer) to their client base.In this article, we focus on authentication, which has become the most critical part of IAM (identity and access management).Data security is the fundamental layer of the cyber defense architecture. This is because data breaches are very costly to enterprises. The average cost of a data breach for a company in the U.S. is almost $8 million, according to PC Magazine. Because of the potential impact to their enterprise, companies are continuing to increase their spending on IAM software. The IAM market alone is projected to reach $13 billion by 2021, according to Forrester Research.Data is what malicious hackers are after and selling the stolen data on the Dark Web, a marketplace for stolen data and personal information, is one of the ways to monetize those well-planned attacks. The infographic below shows the 10 most common pieces of information sold on the Dark Web and their associated price range.The general login info is sold at $1 per user and payment related login info is sold at $20-$200 per user. Here are the common steps involved to steal a userâ€™s login credentials via email phishing:Beyond customersâ€™ login info, imagine a scenario where a data analyst who works at a healthcare organization and has access to patientsâ€™ medical records. If the analystâ€™s privileged account is compromised, hackers have access to both login info and medical records, which are much more damaging. With stolen login credentials, organizations could always ask employees and customers to change their login info quickly before hackers do too much damage to the system. For sensitive, immutable, appendable-only data such as medical records, the privacy violated is irreversible. The bells have rung, they cannot be unrung.Authentication determines who/what can access a system, how they can access a system, and which data they have access to, by verifying information provided based on stored credentials.There are 3 common authentication factors in the form of data that helps us authenticate users:The Username/Password approach is the most common way to authenticate a user, but it is also proven to be very insecure. According to the Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR), â€œ81% of hacking-related breaches leveraged either stolen and/or weak passwords.â€ Itâ€™s very common for individuals to use the same password for both personal use as well as work related applications. According to PixelPrivacy.com, â€œMillennials aged 18â€“31 lead the lame password category parade, with 87% admitting they frequently reuse passwords despite knowing betterâ€. 60 million Dropboxâ€™s user credentials are stolen and available for sale on the Dark Web because of employee password reuse.We will explain why password-based authentication is so vulnerable, why common user practices have made the problem even worse, and why a better solution needs to exist.Plaintext PasswordsðŸ˜±In the early days of computing, passwords were stored in a database as plaintext. The best-known password database is also known as Active Directory (AD), which is a directory service that Microsoft developed for Windows domain networks. Using Active Directory, a user logs into a computer that is part of a Windows domain, then AD checks the submitted password and determines whether the user is legitimate or not. AD covers a broad range of directory-based identity-related services, like management and storage of information and authentication and authorization services.There are multiple problems with Active Directory. The first is that it creates a â€œhoneypotâ€ where hackers can access many passwords at the same time, if they are able to hack a system. The second is that passwords themselves are easily discoverable and replicable, because of their Active Directory allows simple plaintext passwords.Remember our friend, Big Head from the HBO show Silicon Valley (Season 4, Ep 10):Big Head: My username is â€œpasswordâ€ and my password is â€œpassword.â€Richard: Your username is â€œpasswordâ€?Big Head: It was just easier. ðŸ˜€In the early days, AD would store Big Headâ€™s credentials as:Username: passwordPassword: passwordTo solve the glaring vulnerabilities of systems such as Active Directory, engineers invented password hashing.Hashing is a type of algorithm which takes any size of data and converts it into a fixed-length of data. Theoretically speaking, hashing algorithms have the following properties.The most common hashing algorithms being used today isSHA-2When a user tries to log on to the system, after submitting the username and password, the authentication service will convert the password into a hash and check if the hash is matched with the one on file. If it is a match, the userâ€™s access right would be granted.Hashing is more technologically advanced than plaintext from a security perspective, as it adds difficulties for adversaries to access usersâ€™ passwords. With hashing, businesses store a hash of a userâ€™s credentials rather than the plaintext in the AD. If only hashed passwords are stored in the AD, when AD is compromised, hackers would get a list of hashes instead of plaintext passwords. We explain in the next section how to reverse engineer hashes and why it takes time and computing resources.Reverse engineering hashes is not easy but is doable via brute forcing, i.e. to try all the possible inputs until the right one is found. Proof-of-work in bitcoin mining adopts this concept. Mining a block requires the miner to produce a value (aka nonce) that, after being hashed, is less than or equal to one used in the most recent block accepted by the Bitcoin network. The number is between 0 and 256-bit, and miners have to use hard-core GPU/FPGA/ASIC hardware to stay competitive in this brute force competition.Besides brute forcing, hackers can create a very large library of common passwords (common words, namebirthday, etc.), generate hashes for those common passwords, and add those hashes to the library. With the compromised password database, hackers can cross reference the hashes in the library with the hashes in the stolen database. The ones that match are the ones hackers have successfully cracked. In that sense, we have seen services strongly against users using common words or predictable patterns as passwords as they are much easier to be reverse engineered.Salt is another layer added to the password protection. Letâ€™s use Big Headâ€™s credential again.With just hashing no saltingBig Headâ€™s Password: passwordHash stored in AD (assuming SHA-256) A 256-bit, jfu8ysxnngiruyshmxur93xn901imklâ€¦â€¦.With saltingBig Headâ€™s Password: passwordAdd Salt: passwordtgujr (tgujr is the Salt)Salted Hash stored in AD (assuming SHA-256): A 256-bit, ursiiej202hhncspouejj3nx98fnalkjâ€¦â€¦.Itâ€™s worth noting that each password has its own randomly assigned Salt. A userâ€™s password is stored as hash (password+Salt), and Salt is stored as plaintext in AD, which makes it relatively more difficult to crack. When hackers get access to the password database, they cannot simply rely on the pre-generated library of common passwords and hashes to find matches, as every common password is added with a Salt.For a given salt, hackers need to regenerate the hashes for every common password in the library just to identify one password. To cover the whole directory, they have to do it repeatedly until they run through all the salts. Though very computing intensive and time consuming, it is doable!We discussed at length how password-based authentication works. Basically, all the credentials are stored in AD, a centralized database. Once accessed improperly by hackers, all the credentials could be stolen. If stored as plaintext, the stolen credentials could be available for sale on the Dark Web. If stored with hashing, hackers need a bit of computing power to crack those hashes, and the ones with common/predictable passwords are the most vulnerable. If stored with hashing and salting, hackers need a lot more computing power to reverse engineer the salted hashes. The quick takeaway is having credentials stored in one centralized database is very risky. Itâ€™s a gold mine for every hacker, and is susceptible to a variety of other attacks (e.g. phishing, malware), and itâ€™s hackersâ€™ holy grail to crack those hashes.The centralized password database seems to be the problem with password-based authentication, because it enables many passwords to be accessed in one fell swoop if a system is compromised. Is there a way to eliminate that centralized database but still use password as a primary way to authenticate users? There is, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP).ZKP is a cryptographic approach to prove the validity of a statement without revealing any information of the statement. One party (prover) can prove to another party (verifier) that they know the value X without conveying any information of X apart from the fact that they know the value X.Below is how password-based authentication works using Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol, which conveys a zero knowledge proof from User to Server.If Client has Password and Salt and Server has Verifier, they should both have the right inputs to come up with the same session key used to encrypt and decrypt messages. If messages can be verified, it not only proves that Client has Password, but also proves Server has the Verifier. Both are authenticated by their counterpart.Via this approach, Userâ€™s Password (p) and Hashed password (x) never leaves Client or is never passed through the network or stored by Server. Server doesnâ€™t need to know them to be able to authenticate User. In an adversarial scenario, an eavesdropper obtains Serverâ€™s Verifier (v), Salt (s) and g. Theoretically, they could reverse engineer x. With enough computing power, an adversary could also reverse engineer the password given the salt is already known. But this brute force approach is almost mission-impossible given 1) brute force is very time consuming; 2) systems will set up a short time limit for each login session. Users will be asked to re-login, a new salt will be randomly generated, and hackers will have to start over the brute force before they get shut out by the system again.This password-based approach is more secure than the traditional approach that is dependent on a centralized password database. One caveat with this approach is that it requires more communication between Client and Server. In the traditional password approach, Client sends username and password to Server, Server authenticates, and only one round trip is needed. In ZKP, 3 round trips (exchange v, s; exchange A, B; exchange encrypted messages) are required to perform one authentication, which takes longer than one round trip.The ZKP approach is not dependent on the Server knowing exactly what Userâ€™s password is, but this is by no means to encourage users to use simple common words, like abcd, 1234, and password (Big Head ðŸ˜œ). Users still need to follow the password best practice, like using both numbers, letters and special characters, and changing the password periodically. Employees should still separate their work-related passwords from their personal passwords, as we donâ€™t know which application is using ZKP, which stores our hashed passwords and which still stores passwords in plaintext.Endless Passwordsâ€¦â€¦ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜«We understand the caveats of the centralized password-based authentication approach. Developers have come up with an approach to make authentication passwordless by incorporating a userâ€™s mobile phone and biometric authentication. This approach is passwordless by default, which is different from the traditional 2FA or MFA approach where password and centralized password management are still needed.How does passwordless authentication work?Part A: User EnrollmentCharlie is enrolled via the Passwordless App on his phone. Charlieâ€™s phone scans Charlieâ€™s face or fingerprints. The mathematical representation of a face/fingerprint scan, not the actual scanned images, is stored on Charlieâ€™s phone. The information is held locally in the secure enclave, a smartphone chip that is dedicated specifically to securing sensitive data.Part B: User AuthenticationThis approach leverages the widely available, mature technologies such as API, mobile SDK and biometric authentication embedded in smartphones. This approach conducts user authentication at the edge (i.e. userâ€™s mobile phone), eliminates centralized password management, and neither Passwordless nor Dropbox has knowledge of Charlieâ€™s credentials. Neither Passwordless nor Dropbox needs to collect or store usersâ€™ biometric data on their own servers. Charlie no longer needs to memorize different username/password combo for different apps, he only needs to memorize the pin for the Passwordless App. If Charlieâ€™s phone is stolen or hacked, only Charlieâ€™s credentials would be compromised and it would not impact the rest of the user base, which is a huge improvement on risk contamination vs. password-based approach.The caveat of this approach is that itâ€™s device dependent. From Charlieâ€™s perspective, if he switches his phone or his phone is stolen, heâ€™d need to register his new device and re-onboard himself, as his new device needs to authenticate and store his credentials, which might cause friction in the user experience.Albeit at an early-stage stage, this approach is theoretically more advanced than the traditional password-based approach. We have startups such as Woven, HYPR, Groove.ID, Secret Double Octopus evangelizing this approach to enterprises as well as SMBs. It might take a while to educate the market, especially the enterprises, as this approach will introduce a bit of change to the customersâ€™ existing security design. Users might also need some education as many users donâ€™t want to take out their phones every time they log on to a service.Decentralized blockchain-based (or onchain) authentication is to distribute the authentication work to nodes/verifiers in the blockchain network by comparing fresh biometric samples submitted by users from any device with the usersâ€™ biometric templates stored onchain. Letâ€™s start with how it works from a userâ€™s perspective.Part A: User AuthenticationDecentralized onchain authentication, if scalable, high-availability and secure, is theoretically superior to both centralized password-based authentication and passwordless authentication at the edge, as onchain authentication eliminates the centralized password database and distributes the authentication work to the nodes/verifiers without users being device dependent. However, we understand itâ€™s a big IF, as the technology is still at its infancy. Weâ€™ll decompose the decentralized authentication to identify the enabling technologies required to move this approach forward.Part B: Decompose Decentralized Authentication (Step 5 and 6)Verifiers should be randomly assigned for each transaction to ensure decentralization and security. In our case, if this is a permissioned network and we have a few nodes dedicated to serving Dropboxâ€™s authentication requests, this protocol is not necessarily far more superior than the centralized one where authentication is performed by one centralized node. From a security perspective, itâ€™s actually worse than the device-dependent passwordless approach, whereas the authentication is fully distributed to the edge. The designated nodes could easily become targets for adversaries.Bitcoin solved the randomness issue by adopting Proof-of-Work (PoW). We mentioned this earlier in the password approach. This consensus algorithm asks miners to come up with a value that, after being hashed, is less than or equal to the one used in the most recent block accepted by the network. Whoever comes up with a value first gets to propose the next block. The randomness is assured because the only way to do this is through brute force. The security of the chain is also assured as the only way to attack the chain is by owning over 50% of the networkâ€™s computing power, which is at the cost of $1.4B as of Novâ€™18. The major weaknesses of Bitcoin network are 1) very energy consuming, and 2) low-throughput, which make it impossible to handle mission-critical transactions.The high throughput, secure and decentralized protocol is still at its infancy. We have a few Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocol teams are working on this blockchain trilemma.The discussion on how project teams solve the trilemma (like sharding, plasma, different consensus algorithms, etc.) is beyond the scope of this article. Weâ€™d like to focus on onchain technologies that are more directly related to the key topic being discussed today, authentication. Assuming we have a proven high-performance, secure and decentralized protocol that ensures randomness, what are the enabling technologies required for us to have a functioning onchain authentication?Mainstream protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum are not built for privacy-preserving smart contracts. People would argue Bitcoin/Ethereum is anonymous because users can transact bitcoins/ethers on chain with no personal information required. However, itâ€™s not anonymous. Itâ€™s pseudonymous, as every transaction is linked to two specific addresses, a senderâ€™s address and a receiverâ€™s address. Transaction details including amount and time are recorded and revealed onchain. Given how sensitive usersâ€™ biometric data is, an open decentralized blockchain protocol is clearly not a viable choice for authentication. The mathematical representations of usersâ€™ face and fingerprints should not be made publicly available on the blockchain.Authentication requires a privacy-preserving computing protocol. Letâ€™s take a granular look at the approaches protocol teams have tried.B1: Fully Homomorphic EncryptionFully Homomorphic Encryption is an encryption technology that enables computation on encrypted input to generate output that, after decrypted, matches the output of the computation on the original input. In the case of authentication, the protocol would encrypt the mathematical representation of Charlieâ€™s biometric sample as well as the pre-stored biometric template. The protocol then conducts the one-on-one comparison of the encrypted captured sample with the encrypted template, and generates a matching score. Charlieâ€™s access would be granted If the score is above the threshold.Homomorphic encryption is still very much theoretical at this point. It can be used to perform simple arithmetics like addition/subtraction, but it is too early to be adopted in complicated computations, like authentication.B2: Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)TEE is a secure area of a main processor. It guarantees code and data loaded inside of secure enclaves to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. Unlike other privacy approaches, TEE has already been widely adopted and accepted in our day-to-day life. For example, iPhoneâ€™s Touch ID and Face ID are enabled by a secure enclave inside the phone, which stores critical authentication information. The encrypted biometric data goes into the enclave, which decrypts and processes the data, and encrypts the output before it leaves the enclave. The mainstream hardware chips that offer TEE are Intelâ€™s Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX), followed by AMDâ€™s Secure Execution Environment and ARMâ€™s TrustZone.In the case of authentication, Charlieâ€™s encrypted biometric sample and stored template are forwarded to verifiers in the blockchain network. Verifiers perform authentication in their own TEE without Charlieâ€™s data being exposed to outside of secure enclaves. This approach is scalable as computing is offloaded to offchain, which is not subject to onchain scalability issues. The approach is also easier to adopt as most of the computers are loaded with one of the three mainstream chips mentioned above.Despite the high-throughput nature, a major risk associated with this approach is being Intel/AMD/ARM dependent. We need to trust the chip makers that the TEE they created can be trusted. Last year, vulnerabilities like Meltdown, Spectre, Foreshadow uncovered by researchers gave people pause on the implicit security guarantee. Although Intel issued patches for the vulnerabilities discovered, given that secure enclaves have been involved and will continue to be involved in most of the mission-critical tasks, it wonâ€™t be surprising if they continue to be adversariesâ€™ target.We have initiatives from Oasis Labs and Keystone teams to build an open-source secure enclave. The open-source design would 1) allow the community to openly evaluate and improve on the system; 2) allow chips to be manufactured by any chip maker, which reduces the concentration risk on Intel/AMD/ARM.B3: Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)We discussed ZKP at length earlier in the article, as we argue ZKP is a lot more secure than a password-based approach that stores hashed passwords in a centralized database. ZKP could be more easily adopted by password-based approach than passwordless, as itâ€™s much easier to provide ZKP of passwords than biometrics. For biometrics, researchers proposed to generate a biometric key based off the biometric sample via 1) feature extraction; 2) vectorize characteristics; 3) weighing the characteristics; 4) find the key vector that is closest to the series of weights; 5) generate a cryptographic key based on the key vector. Performing ZKP on the cryptographic keys should be much easier than ZKP on pixel-based biometric images. This technology is still very early in terms of implementation, as generating a proof is still a slow process that is far from enterprise-grade yet.B4: Secure Multiparty Computing (sMPC)sMPC is to have multiple parties jointly do computation based on the inputs they have. Every party only see a portion of the encrypted data. Unless every party colludes, no one has access to the full input.sMPC illustrationWe want to compute Z = X * Y, where X = 30 and Y = 70; but we donâ€™t want to reveal the value of X and YWe split X into X1, X2 and X3, where X1= 2, X2= 3, X3= 5We split Y into Y1, Y2 and Y3, where Y1= 5, Y2= 2, Y3= 7We distribute (X1 , Y1), (X2 , Y2), (X3 , Y3) across 3 nodes. Each node comes up with their own multiplication result, Z1= 10, Z2= 6, Z3= 35Z = Z1 * Z2 * Z3 = 2100No node has the value of X or Y, unless all of them decide to colludeBesides low-throughput, one caveat of sMPC is that the output depends on each party to perform the computation honestly. If one party has gone rogue, the output will be incorrect.In the case of authentication, which involves a lot more complicated computation than simple addition and multiplication, the sMPC-based protocol would need to split the binary data of Charlieâ€™s biometric sample and stored template. Each party only gets a portion of both the sample and the template, and compare them to see if there is a pattern underneath. Then the challenge is how to split the sample and template that each piece is small enough that is not anything meaningful on its own, but also big enough that allows for pattern recognition.Beyond privacy-preserving, the blockchain network needs storage to hold usersâ€™ biometric templates to perform verification. How does storage work on blockchain? The mainstream network such as Bitcoin requires every full Bitcoin Core node download/store the entire ledger of onchain transactions. Bitcoin transaction data is pseudonymous by nature, so it is reasonable for every full node to have the full copy.Usersâ€™ login credentials such as biometric templates are private data and should not be publicly stored where every node has a full copy. Hence itâ€™s important to introduce decentralized storage, where data is encrypted, split into pieces and shared across nodes that have idle storage capacity.Weâ€™ll use IPFS as a decentralized storage protocol for illustrative purposes. To store usersâ€™ biometric templates, the full template and all the blocks (which means the single unit of data) within it will be assigned with a unique cryptographic hash. Blocks are stored across multiple random nodes. Every node is equipped with a storage index to know which node is storing what. During retrieval, the network will find nodes storing the data based on the unique cryptographic hash.This enabling technology is still early, as we need to solve technical issues such as scalability, proof of space and proof of replication, etc..We live in a world dominated by password-based authentication, and we have seen risks and incidents associated with that approach. We discussed the dominant approach and a couple of its alternatives. A quick rundown on pros and cons:Authentication is critical to usersâ€™ day-to-day life as well as businessesâ€™ day-to-day operations. We believe the three new approaches we discussed could coexist in the future. There is no clear winner at this point that could perfectly balance security, technology maturity and user experience.For most companies out there that are using password-based authentication, we encourage them to:For companies who are working on device-dependent passwordless authenticationApproach go-to-market in the Enterprise space with patienceFor builders and project teams that are working on the privacy methodologies such as fully homomorphic encryption, sMPC, TEE and ZKP and Web 3.0 stacks e.g. protocol layer, network layer, infrastructure layerAuthentication is such a fascinating topic. This article is by no means comprehensive coverage of everything you need to know about authentication or how it will evolve in the future. If anything, we just scratched the surface. Many enabling technologies mentioned above need to happen before we can have a secure, high-performance authentication approach with great user experience. We look forward to seeing multidisciplinary collaboration among computer scientists, mathematicians, cryptographers, economists, etc, to advance these developments. ðŸ¤“We feel extremely honored to get to know a lot of amazing entrepreneurs and builders in this community.

Subscribe to The Beam for more.In recent months, news about the solar energy industry was dominated by headlines describing record-breaking tariffs, reflecting the fast declining price of solar electricity. In the midst of the global climate protests taking place, led by Greta Thunberg and her Fridays for Future movement, the hope is that further commitments to reducing emissions will lead to further growth in the global solar power portfolio.As the industry continues to adapt to the present social and economic realities, ambitious regulations in France and discussions on sustainable product policies in the European Union are pushing for more transparency and environmental accountability in solar â€” setting a best practice example of how to effectively account and factor in externalities in public procurement of electricity, a practice now implemented for large-scale solar, which should have been implemented for fossil-fuel-based generation technologies decades ago (and still isnâ€™t).While the focus has been on the attractive economics of utility-scale solar, it is often taken for granted that solar energy is inherently environmentally sustainable, leading many to believe that its carbon credentials donâ€™t require scrutiny. The fact is, even solar power plants carry with them a lifecycle environmental footprint. These lifecycle environmental footprints can range from 12g of CO2 per kWh for a facility using thin-film modules, to as much as 80g per kWh â€” for one using multi-crystalline silicon panels.According to the European Commission Product Environmental Footprint methodology, upstream processes generate between 80 to just over 95% of the emissions in a PV power plantâ€™s life cycle. This includes the extraction of raw materials, production of semiconductor materials, manufacturing of modules and Balance of Systems (BoS) components, and construction. This staggering figure shows that the onus lies squarely on manufacturers to deliver low carbon solutions to customers.â€œWith young people around the globe demanding accountability for carbon use, it is up to those in the industry to answer the call and deliver sustainable solutions to power our future generations.â€The comparatively high carbon footprint of multi-crystalline silicon panels is a direct result of the energy-intensive processes required to refine silicon. It is also a direct consequence of the fact that the manufacturing of silicon panels has largely moved from markets where electricity has a low carbon intensity, to countries that often rely on coal and other carbon-intensive forms of electricity generation. As a result, many of todayâ€™s commodity PV modules may come with a heavy environmental price tag.However, as we transition to tender-based renewable energy programs, regulators in Europe and beyond, now have an opportunity to build on the gains made in reducing the overall environmental impact of their power generation portfolios. New policies that make it necessary for independent power producers to competitively bid for generation licences allow governments to ensure that theyâ€™re nurturing a renewable energy sector that is both cost and carbon competitive.How? Following Franceâ€™s effective pioneering of carbon footprint requirements in utility-scale solar PV tenders a couple of years ago, the European Commission is currently investigating potential eco-design, eco-labelling and green public procurement criteria for solar PV modules, inverters and PV systems.While today still most competitive tenders focus on price and technical compliance, Franceâ€™s Agence de Lâ€™Environnement et de la MaÃ®trise de lâ€™Energie (ADEME) has designed a system to ensure that the country derives maximum value â€” and not just in the financial sense of the term â€” from its utility-scale solar energy investments. Taking these learning as well as the results of the Product Environmental Footprint Pilot phase for PV electricity, the EU is evaluating the feasibility for the implementation of new sustainable product policies in the coming years.A recent tender for 200 megawatts (MW) of solar power placed a 15% evaluation premium on projects that used PV modules with low carbon footprints. In other words, developers that wanted to win a Power Purchase Agreement in France needed to compete on more than just price â€” they needed to compete on the environmental sustainability of their projects. As a number of industries lag far behind in reducing lifetime carbon footprints, low carbon solar PV offers the opportunity for new renewable energy installations to pick up even more of the slack.While reaction to the policy has been mixed, I would argue that it actually helps the country ensure that its renewable energy program is as environmentally sustainable as it can possibly be. Furthermore, it demonstrates how externalities of electricity generation can be effectively integrated in public procurement processes â€” demonstrating a viable path for all technologies.The implementation of these policies falls in line with the demands of Fridayâ€™s for Future protesters around Europe, calling for a drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions â€” as viability for these policy instruments gets proven for solar photovoltaics, it is about time to adopt similar frameworks for the whole energy sector to further accelerate the much needed transformation of the EU energy industry.Franceâ€™s progressive policy on reducing the carbon footprint of its solar energy program serves as a precedent for other countries to follow. The tools â€” such as Franceâ€™s competitive tender structure and the European initiative to evaluate ecolabels, eco-design and green public procurement criteria for PV modules â€” already exist.And as PV is established as the lowest priced electricity, it is time to level the playing field further and include the environmental externalities of electricity generation in this equation. With young people around the globe demanding accountability for carbon use, it is up to those in the industry to answer the call and deliver sustainable solutions to power our future generations.Sponsored content by Eco Innovation Alliance.This article was featured in The Beam #9 â€” Voices from the Global South.

Without us noticing the sophistication of technology, someoneâ€™s perspective and mentality has also changed when doing something. As the development of the media era, these leaves and stones were abandoned because they were considered not to comply with safety standards. Authpaper appears as a Blockchain technology platform that actively uses QR code technology in all operating systems. If we look at the naked eye, the QR code is just a rectangular image that has an illegible writing.Basically, the task of fighting the perpetrators of counterfeits is not just the duty of the security forces. Product shipments are frequent now, at home and abroad. This is proof that human interaction in the era of globalization is now expanding its network and is capable of reaching a global scale. This happens because only by scanning with a smartphone the user can easily view the information and invite friends online. Therefore, with this certificate, automatic paper technology can be sent online, then you will be presented with a QR code that demonstrates the authenticity of the certificate. Another example, if you establish a cooperation agreement between companies. So, at least certainly as business actors, we want a cooperation contract in the form of a certificate in the form of software.This method certainly tarnished the good name of the educational institution whose name was involved in a series of false documents. Worse, document falsification can be done by someone who has the mission of attacking or destroying a country. But the business system played this role before the platform was built. The concept of building this platform is due to the growing trend in the use of cryptocurrencies by the government in several transactions that previously involved the function of the bills. Digital currencies are now beginning to prepare to catch up with the passage of bills.It sounds simple, but without us knowing that there will be many small gaps or unexpected opportunities for companies to commit document fraud. For example, in the case of sending a number of important documents between a department and another department. Another component that also requires official recognition is the services. Did you know that if you want to become a professional diver who can work on a particular rescue mission or teach others, the diver must also show some evidence or certification? Certainly, all companies have non-physical data that have very high sensitivity properties. Therefore, I also needed a number of technologies that are very effective in overcoming this. Authpaper also expands its use in coupon systems. For example, when creating a QR code coupon, users can detect if the coupon is still valid or not. Surgical with ordinary coupons that do not have a QR code, it will be very difficult to detect the expiration time.Links :WEBSITE: https://www.authpaper.ioWHITEPAPER: https://www.authpaper.io/#whitepaperTWITTER: https://twitter.com/authpaperMEDIUM: https://medium.com/@icoauthpapercoinTELEGRAM: https://t.me/authpaperREDDIT: https://www.reddit.com/user/authpaperICO+++++++++++++++++++++++ETH: 0x400EeA8bA2f305D632Bf1Fa2F50c9ed4f47FEA7F----Story with--Story with--Story with--Story with--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Josep FerrerinGeek Culture--72HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

For some of us, the craving is so bad that we let people get beaten right before our eyes â€” just so we can record it â€” or even worse, we record ourselves hurting other peopleâ€” just for the attention.The live-stream of New Zealandâ€™s mass-shooting spread across the internet like wildfire, as social media platforms struggled to contain it. But the cruel curiosity surrounding the video made it too elusive to catch. After one knew the video existed, the desire to see it was like an itch you couldnâ€™t scratch. So, enterprising users re-posted the video on different platforms in multiple areas, vying for the attention that such a tragedy brings along with it.The shooter knew the stream was going to make him famous (as long as his body count was high enough). Mainstream news sources have reported his name, his picture, along with bits of his life. They gathered an audience for the killerâ€™s motives, voicing the hatred of a psychopath on the most highly respected media outlets across the world. Stillâ€¦ nothing compares to the video itself; circulating like a tornado, it was stiff competition for the news media.The New Zealand video is just the tip of the iceberg â€” below it, moments of suffering fester in the thousands, as â€˜enterprisingâ€™ users seek to benefit off the tragedy of others. The most recent video that comes to mind takes place on what looks to be a subway train, wherein a young man kicks an elderly woman, who has no other choice but to sit and wait until he stops. From the sound on the video, there seems to be at least three able-bodied men shouting â€˜ohhhh,â€™ doing nothing as the assailant swaggers off the train.Thatâ€™s not even the worse of it. In 2017, a woman in Kuwait recorded her maid hanging with one hand out of a window, shrieking â€˜hold meâ€™ before she slips and falls. The woman doing the filming claimed she was afraid that she would be accused of murdering the woman. She let someone almost die right in front of her in order to save herself a trip to the courtroom. (Luckily she was taken to court anyway).One explanation for this behavior is the well-known â€˜bystander effect,â€™ which essentially holds that when a large group of people stand witness to an emergency situation, the sheer number of onlookers encourages them to do nothing. As a social species, we have an internal drive to earn the acceptance of those around us. Itâ€™s also a trait we are taught in grade school, as teachers want students to conform to a certain standard of behavior. After punishing those who disrupt the class, soon enough children start looking to each other when they donâ€™t know what is expected, learning how to act from the herd, not the teacher.But this explanation must be expanded in order to carry relevance in the case of the maid falling out the window, as there were only two people involved. The womanâ€™s gut reaction to the unfolding emergency was to grab her phone, instead of the victimâ€™s hand. She was the only bystander in the roomâ€¦ until she hit record â€” then there were potentially millions of people standing along with her.This phenomena is quite new, as only recently have we grown accustomed to having cameras in our pockets. There is always the possibility of being watched, recorded and placed on the internet for all to see. And there is always the possibility to watch, record and earn digital currency off the actions of others.One aspect of the issue has been well-studied: social media rewards us for generating popular content with views and likes, which trigger a dopamine-release in our brain. Dopamine â€” the brain chemical associated with positive reinforcement, pleasure, and addiction â€” is a biological facet of the craving we feel for things like sex and attention. Oneâ€™s mood can drop significantly if a recent post fails to capture enough eyes, temporarily raising levels of anxiety and depression. For those who place too much emphasis on social media, â€˜viewsâ€™ and â€˜likesâ€™ become a drug of choice, requiring higher and higher dosages for the â€˜fixâ€™ to kick in.The urge to record a man kicking an old lady, instead of helping the old lady, can possibly be attributed to our own internal drive for attention and acceptance. Only, our means of satisfying this drive have been distorted by our devices. We know, as the New Zealand shooterâ€™s live-stream is a clear example, that if we record something horrific and disturbing, people will tune in. By extension, if I post something awful happening to you â€” your tragedy becomes my dopamine release; and if Iâ€™m lucky, I might even garner empathy for just having been there.â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€”Iâ€™m sort of a heretic, because I donâ€™t go to church or read the Bible, yet I call myself a Christian. One aspect of the moral philosophy which has always resonated with me is the emphasis on â€˜embodied truth,â€™ which holds that itâ€™s not enough to simply believe, one must enact their beliefs in the world. In other words, if youâ€™re going to walk around thinking youâ€™re a good person, you better act like it.When an emergency is happening, put your phone down and get your fists up. A few â€˜likesâ€™ shouldnâ€™t be worth the memory that you did nothing while an old lady was beaten in front of you.

It is a battle to be the first, the best, and the wisest. Innovators, Startups, and Investors are also keen to take advantage of the oncoming wave that is slated to start a revolution in the way we connect.So, when can we expect this wave to hit us? What exactly should we expect? Moreover, How much of an impact will it have? Letâ€™s take a closer look at 5G and the timeline for the expected release:I could quickly point you to the 1990s, where mobile operators were experimenting with the latest mobile radio technologies. As an operator, the decision of which technology to use to implement their mobile network was crucial to their competitive advantage.In the past, many US telecom operators adopted proprietary CDMA technology, while Europe mandated the use of GSM. Regardless of which technology was better at the time, there was a consensus among governing bodies that mobile technology should be standardized.Enter 3GPP in 1998.Think of 3GPP (The 3rd Generation Partnership Project) as a committee of experts who come up with specifications for new mobile radio technology releases. Due to their effort, phone and device manufacturers build according to the same standards allowing for greater compatibility across mobile networks.Each publication 3GPP releases is numbered. For example, they published Release 8 in the third quarter of 2008, with specifications of 4G-LTE. It was not until 2 years later, in 2010, that we first saw the 4G network available to the public.Due to manufacturing and implementation delays, it takes about 2 years, from when 3GPP announces a specification before network operators finally apply it to their networks.2018â€“2020: Release of 4G-LTE Advanced Pro by many Operators.Todayâ€™s wireless networks have run into a problem. More people and devices are consuming even more data than ever before. So the current 4G airwaves are getting crowded and, as a result, the quality of service that mobile operators offer is diminishing. A simple way to get around this problem is to transmit signals on a new range of the wireless spectrum. We do have a wide range available, although there is a catch:Higher frequencies can transmit a lot of data, very efficiently, at high speeds. They also have a shorter range and a higher tendency to be blocked by obstacles and weather conditions. On the flip side, lower frequencies can transmit less data, and can more easily traverse obstacles and weather conditions.4G is using the megahertz band, while 5G is using the higher gigahertz band. So 5G has a much higher bandwidth, lower latency, better reliability; But it also has a lower range and has a higher propensity to be blocked by weather and objects.Putting this into perspective: a typical 4G tower can cover a 70km area while a 5G tower can cover a maximum of 500m! Having a nationwide coverage with only a standalone 5G network is a massive undertaking, requiring a multitude of antennas in a cluster, and would not be profitable for low population areas.So it is safe to say that 4G LTE technology is not going anywhere. In fact, 3GPP has already prepared advanced and innovative versions of 4G LTE specifications as a backbone and stepping stone for the next era of mobile networks. In 2016â€“2017, they published Release 13 & 14 as the evolution of 4G to work side-by-side with 5G. It is called 4G LTE Advanced Pro, and it promises higher speeds, greater reliability, and compatibility with 5G.Expect 4G LTE advanced Pro to be released between 2018 and 2020, some operators will call it 4.5G or4.5G pro. Others will call it 4.9G, while some would be brash enough to claim it as â€˜5G evolutionâ€™ or â€˜5G projectâ€™ (hint, hint AT&T). It will promise speeds of 1â€“2 Gbps but will probably deliver something between 100â€“300 Mbps under normal circumstances.2020â€“2021 : Release of 5G New Radio pockets in dense areas.When will we get 5G service? The answer to this question is 5G New Radio, also known as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB). In mid-2018, 3GPP published its specifications for 5G New Radio. This, essentially, laid out standards for laying out 5G networks both in standalone and non-standalone networks.The non-standalone specification detailed the introduction of 5G with the existing 4G-LTE backbone, which is the most obvious way forward for most Telecom operators. This due to the currently laid out infrastructure of 4G-LTE, as well as the very low coverage range of 5G cell towers.So for the foreseeable future, our mobile networks would be 4G-LTE with pockets of 5G within dense areas. This is the non-standalone specification that most Telecom operators would follow.This would radically improve our current mobile network in terms of speed and reliability. It would also allow a person on a mobile network to seamlessly transition between a 5G tower and a 4G tower depending on their bandwidth needs and their distance from the 5G tower. Expect New Radio to be how the majority of consumers experience 5G in the upcoming years.Expect the first 5G pockets to start appearing by 2020; and this only for the most forward-looking mobile operators and companies. It will promise speeds of 20 Gbps, but will most likely deliver something around 1 Gbps under normal circumstances.2022+ : Release of 5G+, URLCC & mMTC â€” 5G on steroids.As 5G New Radio pockets slowly pop up around us by 2020, we would feel a vast improvement in our mobile connectivity. For the first time, reliability & speed will become comparable to dedicated fixed internet services. However, by 2022, the 5G networks will slowly evolve with new specifications and technology that will take our wireless networks to new heights.Many will argue that the real excitement of 5G is 3GPPâ€™s release 16 which will be published at the end of 2019; Think of this as an evolution of 5G similar to the development of 4G-LTE since its introduction in 2008. This will bring with it detailed specifications on improving 5G to support automation, Internet of Things (IoT), private networks and other network-critical applications.Internet of Many Things: mMTC (massive machine type communications). Think of a connected world, where a street lamp communicates with your car, your watch communicates with a weather sensor, your fridge communicates with the milk cartonâ€™s expiry sticker, soil sensors communicate with water sprinklers. This myriad of devices communicating is what IoT is about. We would need a network that supports many, many devices reliably, with the possibility of adding many, many more. We would also require a low power, cheap, antenna with a long battery life for such applications. This is what mMTC specification is trying to achieve.The limitations of a connected world are always the network that connects it.mMTC will introduce specifications for 5G to support up to 1 Million devices per square kilometer, increased battery life of antennas to 10 years, and allow longer range than current IoT wireless networks.Fast and Reliable, even on the move: URLLC (ultra reliable low latency communications) Imagine a moving autonomous car on a highway. It would need to communicate with other cars and objects while moving at high speeds. You would also need a low latency connection (a fast response time) to ensure safety on the road; as even the smallest delay could be detrimental. Remote surgery, for example, although a far-fetched idea for todayâ€™s standard, would be another use case. In fact, any real-time mission-critical applications are heavily reliant on fast response times.URLLC will allow 5G to boast very accurate and very reliable network specification with 1ms latency and 1 packet loss per billion, even for antennas that are moving at up to 500 km/h.The use-cases of 5G are a little overwhelming. On the one hand, we have standard mobile broadband that requires high bandwidth with decent latency (eMBB), on the other end, we have connected sensors, smart-home devices and other IoT applications that require low powered antennas and high device density (mMTC). On yet another use-case, we have autonomous vehicles and mission-critical applications that need reliable connections on the move with very low latency (URLLC). There are many other network applications and requirements, and it would be a little overwhelming to provide a separate 5G network for each case. The solution to this dilemma is Network Slicing.Think of Network Slicing as a method to allow a single 5G infrastructure to support all use cases under one unified network.So the same 5G tower that would allow you to stream videos on your mobile device, would also provide an ultra-reliable network for your self-driving vehicle, and power the sensors and devices of smart-city devices; The only difference would be the type of antenna used in each of the devices.Although a little more complex, slicing is akin to creating a Virtual network of sorts, where the underlying 5G network can be virtually sliced into separate networks with different requirements. This would simplify the deployment complexity of 5G networks, and significantly reduce time-to-market of different networks. It would also greatly reduce the barrier to entry and costs in setting up a city or country-wide network of many things.I mean who can wait around for those lazy mobile network operators to set up a 5G network for us, right? Letâ€™s do it ourselves.With the 3GPP announcement in the December 2018 conference, they shall be including specifications and standards on the unlicensed New Radio spectrum in the next release, due at the end of 2019. This after the pressure from various industries, namely the automotive industry, in wanting to take advantage of the ultra-flexible 5G network.The launch of 4G-LTE Advanced ProAlso known as 4.5G, 4.5G pro, 4.9G, Pre-5G, Theoretical Speed: 3 GBps, Advertised Speed: 1â€“2 Gbps, Actual Speed: 200â€“300 MbpsThe latest flavour of 4G-LTE networks is starting to appear in many places. This is very significant, in that 4.5G will be the generational backbone for the implementation of any public 5G network in the forseeable future.The launch of 5G New Radio in select locationsAlso known as New Radio, Theoretical Speed: 20 Gbps, Actual Speed: 1 GbpsWhen the initial 5G deployments do come in, most of them will rely on 4G-LTE networks for some services, while using 5G networks for others. Factories and private companies will set up their own 5G networks internally for their IoT requirements.The emergence of IoT & Mission Critical Applications on 5GAlso known as URLLC & mMTC, Theoretical Speed: 20 Gbps, Latency: 1 ms, Mobility: 500 Km/h, Density:: 1 Million devices per squared Km, Reliability: 1 per billion packet loss.This takes 5G and adds hardware and operation specifications to create high reliability and density networks within 5G coverage areas. We shall be seeing 5G URLLC covered roads, where autonomous cars will begin testing, in areas with 5G coverage. We shall also be seeing more data being collected and analyzed than ever before, through millions of devices communicating with 5G towers.It is a consensus in the industry that the road to introducing 5G is a multi-year process with constant changes to future specs.We can take a step back and just let our imagination run wild. The excitement within the industry among professionals and non-professionals alike about the possibilities of 5G is justified, as it not only unifies our wireless communication network but also enables some of the wildest and most innovative products and applications in the future.I cannot wait to see all the ideas and businesses that pop up. It is indeed an exciting time in the telecommunication industry.This post first appeared on the Unconventional Blog at https://theunconventional.blog/5g-the-internet-of-many-fast-things/----The Unconventional BlogA technologist, entrepreneur, and investor.

The son told his mother you should have ordered this stuff online because now we wonâ€™t be able to get lunch at the restaurant. His mother looked at her phone for the time and said, â€œ Youâ€™re right, we donâ€™t have time to go to the restaurant but, I will make it up to you by having it delivered by Doordash and it should arrive by the time we get home, that way we can still get to eat together like I promised before I drop you off. While I pay for the stuff will you use the App to order our food?â€Being able to multi-task is almost everyoneâ€™s favorite thing about technology. You can now be anywhere, and it can be anytime, and you can get almost anything done on the spot. This â€œmicrowave cultureâ€ is amazing as it is scary.According to Bank My Cell, an electronics recycler, the machines have officially taken over with almost 1 billion additional mobile connections than there are people, mobile device connections have surpassed the number of people in the world, making it the fastest growing man-made technology phenomenon ever.The latest Pew Research fact sheet on internet and technology noted that 96% of Americans own a cellphone and nearly three-quarters of U.S. adults now own desktop or laptop computers, while roughly half now own tablet computers and half own e-reader devices. In addition, a growing share of Americans now use smartphones as their primary means of online access at home and one-in-five American adults are â€œsmartphone-onlyâ€ internet users.The explosive growth in technology has obviously changed how we function day to day but, it has been said that it is also changing our minds. Humans along with the human-experience and technology are beginning to merge into one. People are developing mental health conditions as noted in an online article by the BBC which highlighted the growing problem of Nomophobia â€” or no mobile phone phobia â€” the onset of severe anxiety on losing access to your smartphone. The effects of technological disconnection on mental health and being able to function at work are widely known and documented. This can easily lead many of us to question. Are we spiraling out of control with technology and will being human be redefined?I contacted Kate Drazner Hoyt an Assistant Professor of Communication in Film and Media at Pacific Lutheran University to answer questions about our growing technological evolution. Dr. Drazner Hoyt holds a Master of Fine Arts in Emergent Digital Practices from the University of Denver and a Ph.D. in Communication Studies, also from the University of Denver. Her research interests lie at the intersection of critical rhetoric, media and technology studies, and affect. Through her work, she explores the materiality of the virtual â€” how virtual worlds come to impact our physical worlds and how these virtual-physical entanglements intersect with varying systems of power and marginality. Specifically, she is interested in how the virtual implicates the physical body, through both representation and the affective register. Dr. Drazner Hoyt produces traditional scholarship as well as creative research, specializing in projection mapping, wearable technology, 2D/3D animation and installation.How has technology affected human development?Thatâ€™s a huge question, but it is undeniable that technology has affected human development. For one, our memory and processes for recall have shifted to a dependence on external devices. I can still remember my best friendâ€™s phone number from when I was growing up and didnâ€™t have a cell phone, but I cannot tell you any of my current friendsâ€™ phone numbers. There is also an expectation for immediate answers and solutions, due to our ability to search for and find information so easily. As a result, I would say that the pace of human life has sped up exponentially and that our tolerance for performing tasks that take extended periods of time and prolonged periods of focus has decreased. Weâ€™ve also become more influenced by the media that is constantly in our faces, on our devices, and in our personal spaces. There are also smaller peculiarities in terms of unintended effects of technology use. Smartphones, for example, have changed the way we physically navigate the world: our fixation with virtual happenings, aided by the never-ceasing pings of notifications, have rendered â€œtech neckâ€ â€” a flattening of the cervical spine that develops from constant smartphone use â€” the ergonomic conundrum of the 21st century. Similarly, phantom vibrations â€” imagined haptic signals emanating from smart devices â€” plague users even when devices are nowhere around. Finally, â€œsmartphone insomniaâ€ has ushered in a new generation of sleepless people kept awake by their deviceâ€™s blue light emanating from their beds.Itâ€™s been said a text message can provoke a sensory reaction due to its personalized nature and is proof that technology is begging to become more. Essentially that technology is becoming an extension of what it means to be human. Do you agree?Well, there is a theory introduced by the â€œgrandfather of Media Studies,â€ Marshall McLuhan that says, â€œâ€‹Media are extensions of Man [sic].â€‹â€ Meaning that media technologies act as extensions of our bodiesâ€™ sense-making organs â€” our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin, etc. An obvious application of this would be the telescope acting as an extension of our eye. Scholars that follow McLuhanâ€™s philosophy go on to say that the human desire to add on and combine mediated sensemaking technologies â€” think about Facebookâ€™s 360 degree or panoramic photo features, where if you move your phone, the position of the photo rotates, which adds movement to image â€” is a desire to actually experience the virtual as unmediated, or basically as if we were â€œactually there.â€ In this theory, the authors say that through hyper mediation (or the combination of many kinds of mediated sensemaking into one experience), humans want to â€œrecreate the rich sensorium of life.â€ So, yes, I would say that when we experience a text-based messaging system, there is a desire to make it become more, which one could argue is why weâ€™ve invented things like emojis, bitmojis, and gifs.Do you feel technology has granted us greater connection or has it diluted the culture by diminishing inter-personal relationships and interactions?Well, interpersonal relationships and interactions still exist aplenty through technology, but perhaps it is the type of interaction that has changed. Malcolm Gladwell, the author of â€‹Tipping Pointâ€‹, â€‹once argued that social media changes the types of relationships we have from strong to weak ties. â€‹ Meaning, we have a lot more connections, but many of them are shallower than the connections we have offline. Thereâ€™s also the tribalism that occurs in online discourse, where all grey areas disappear, and it often becomes a black and white type of battle â€” youâ€™re either my ally or my enemy, and nothing in between. Certainly, our relationships have changed as a result of technology, but I tend to be wary of arguments that claim technology is always one thing, either good or evil. A lot of good has come from the connections we make through technology â€” and a lot of hazards, too.How do you think social media will change in the future? What will be different from now?Itâ€™s interesting to see the calls for more transparency and privacy happening both within the general public and from governments. This call may take hold, securing privacy and transparency in social media platforms. But what I think is more likely is that social media companies will find other, subtler, and more intrusive ways of capturing user data and selling it to advertisers. And I donâ€™t see society protesting this. The disturbing trend I see, which my students think is no big deal, is what is happening with the trend of so-called â€œsocial media influencers.â€ Peopleâ€™s entire identities become wrapped around selling products in order to receive kickbacks from sponsoring corporations. The reason I find this disturbing is because users are blending their intimate, personal lives and their personal relationships with market capitalism in a way weâ€™ve never seen before so that their identity becomes inseparable from the products they sell. I can also see social media platforms expanding to encompass more and more features and uses in order to make users dependent on it. In China, thereâ€™s a â€œSuperappâ€ called â€‹Wechatâ€‹ that encompasses chat/messaging, social media posts, payment, a â€œCity Servicesâ€ feature where you can book doctorsâ€™ appointments, pay utility bills, pay fines, book transportation, the list goes on. We can already see Instagram adopting the features of Snapchat, Twitter stealing from Instagram, and Facebook stealing from all of them. Itâ€™s reasonable to predict that soon these platforms will be so bloated with added features that it will become impossible to navigate society without an account.The Good, the bad and the ugly. Can you pick and explain examples of how this has or will apply to technology use?How about if I take the example of video technology? The good is that, with those with means walking around with high-quality video recording devices in their pockets, we can capture instances of injustice, such as police violence, for posterity. Aesthetically, video recording techniques such as drone videography or video effects technology can make for some visually stunning filmmaking.The bad is that, with the mass availability of video recording devices, such as smartphone cameras or video drones, we no longer have the expectation of privacy â€” even in our homes. Privacy, while a big concern among Americans, is still being sacrificed easily by everyday folks who willingly post recordings of their most intimate moments for all the world to see. Finally, the ugly can be seen in the â€œfake newsâ€ phenomenon â€” fake news referring to falsified reports, propaganda being peddled as news, and â€œnews outletsâ€ that are little more than mouthpieces for an extreme ideological spin â€” and how this interacts with cutting-edge developments in video and audio-manipulation tools. â€‹Radiolab has a great podcast episodeâ€‹ on tools currently being developed that learn a personâ€™s speech pattern from 20 minutes of video or audio, which can then manipulate the personâ€™s voice and image to appear to be saying anything that you can type. They demonstrate how dangerous this can be with a â€‹test they did on the image and voice of President Obamaâ€‹, whom they made appear to be saying that heâ€™s giving up politics for golf.How do you define Technoculture?I think of technoculture as the culture (norms, rituals, practices, etc.) that grow out of technological developments within communities or within society at large. Itâ€™s important to bear in mind that technology is developed within already existing cultures, often as a response to a need or a market that presents itself within these cultures. So, really, we shouldnâ€™t think of technology creating cultures from scratch, but rather cultures adapting to the technological developments that emerge.Is there still a definite separation of technology and culture?I would argue that there never was. Technology has basically defined humanity from its evolution â€” we are technology-using animals, from the prehistoric spears used to hunt, to fire, to the technology of writing. Human culture was borne out of the practices and rituals associated with technology use, for example, pre-writing, we lived in â€œoral cultures,â€ whereas after, this shifted to a â€œwriting-based culture.â€ So, I argue that culture is inseparable from technology use.Is technology an equalizer? â€‹Not necessarily. Technological practices are still subject to the cultures, structures, and inequalities that predate them. Going back to my example of cellphone videos capturing police violence, these videos havenâ€™t really made a dent in the number of officers who are prosecuted following a fatal encounter with a civilian â€” particularly a civilian of color â€” because our overall culture still puts these victims at a disadvantage, still puts the burden of proof for convicting a police officer incredibly high, and still values the lives of white police-shooting victims above those of color. For technology to be an equalizer, there must be changes to the culture that the technology grows out of.Is technology causing a class divide between those who have access and those who do not have access?Of course. As technology becomes more embedded in everyday life, it becomes an expectation that people have access to these technologies. This disadvantages those on the other side of the â€œâ€‹digital divideâ€‹â€ â€” think about how hard it would be to even get a job if one doesnâ€™t have a computer or smartphone and therefore canâ€™t correspond via email. On the other hand, communities are developing innovative and creative ideas to equalize access in areas where access is limited. In the 2009 protests in Iran, for instance, the government cut off or intentionally slowed down internet access so that protesters couldnâ€™t post updates to Twitter as the governmentâ€™s militia brutally cracked down on them. So, people started using a service called â€œâ€‹text-to-tweetâ€‹â€ using cell signals to communicate developments on the ground to Twitter, which were then picked up by the Western media and broadcast. While lack of access to technologies can disadvantage communities, sometimes this lack can lead to ingenuity in developing workarounds.There has been an argument that technology is enforcing stereotypes in society, what are your thoughts?If this is referring to algorithms made to personalize our media use from the user profiles companies create from our data, then absolutely. For example, in a â€‹chilling episode from the technology podcast Note to Selfâ€‹, that does an in-depth exploration of Facebookâ€™s hidden user profiles that the company sells to advertisers. They put each user in various categories designed to attract certain advertisers. For example, Facebook has a category of user type they call â€œAfrican American affinity,â€ meaning you are either African American, or you consider yourself an ally for black causes. And those with the â€œAfrican- American affinityâ€ tag are often added into another sub-category called â€œinterested in Jewish American culture.â€ Which is a bit of a leap and relies on very odd assumptions and broad-sweeping generalizations. While allyship can be a good thing, when this category is sold to advertisers, it can affect their advertising tactics, which may reinforce stereotypes when marketing to this label or category. Safiya Umoja Nobleâ€‹ â€‹wrote an amazing book called â€‹Algorithms of Oppressionâ€‹, and out of the many examples she gives, and out of the many instances of algorithmic stereotyping she gives, thereâ€™s a really profound one that links Google searches for â€œblack girlsâ€ with higher rates of sexually-explicit content in the results than if one were to search for â€œwhite girls.â€ At one point, â€‹Google would boost results for arrest records to the front page of any search for a black-sounding nameâ€‹. Imagine what these linkages to images of blackness in the collective imagination of American culture, and how damaging that can be. However, itâ€™s important to note that itâ€™s not necessarily the technology enforcing these stereotypes, itâ€™s the people engineering the algorithms that make these choices, whether intentional or unintentional.How can we harness technology to help the underprivileged in the world?â€‹I think providing access to the flow of information, along with digital-literacy training in underserved communities and developing countries, can go far in empowering communities to improve their situation. Iâ€™m always wary of the paternalist approaches to global aid that the developed world often carries out â€” coming into a community, implementing a band-aid solution that doesnâ€™t even involve the people who live there and then leaving without enabling people to keep the solution sustainable. Thatâ€™s why I think empowering folks with technology to create their own solutions is a better approach. There is the now-famous story of William Kamkwamba, who taught himself to make a wind turbine for his town after researching in the local library. Imagine what he could have done with the worldâ€™s information library at his fingertips! I think that access to a free flow of information can be an invaluable resource for people to make incredible changes in their own communities, rather than being subject to the paternalist actions of the powerful.Whatâ€™s the most effective use of technology you have seen?This question is so big, it really made me draw a blank, but ultimately what I thought of was CRISPR, which is an incredibly complicated genetic mechanism, but ultimately what it does is allow scientists to edit DNA. It can be used to correct genetic defects, treat and prevent certain types of diseases, and even improve cropsâ€™ growth. But it also raises concerns about ethics, and how, in the wrong hands, it can be used to create â€œdesigner babies,â€ where parents can edit things like height, eye and hair color, and other characteristics of their offspring. This obviously can create a slippery slope when used in extremes, leading to a type of engineered genocide, where certain traits could be entirely wiped out in communities. â€‹ â€‹The most efficient technologies can also be the most dangerous when used with malicious intent.What do you see as the greatest impact technology has had on society?Thatâ€™s a very difficult question to answer! If pressed, however, I think that the proliferation of and access to infinite amounts of knowledge and information, as was ushered in by the commercial availability of internet-based technologies, has had a tremendous impact on the way humans think, communicate, and relate to one another. First, the almost immediate availability of answers to almost any question that comes to mind has changed the way that humans store memory. We no longer feel the need to remember things internally, and instead can be said to â€œoutsourceâ€ our memory onto devices. With this infinite storage of knowledge, however, humans have the ability to pick and choose information that conforms to their belief systems, which has led to the wholesale rejection of fact-based reality in some communities â€” think of Flat Earthers, climate science deniers, or anti-vaxxers, who reject long-standing, confirmed science about the world in favor of a reconstructed worldview that conforms to specific ideology.What does the future look like to you with technology?Unpredictable! Itâ€™s funny to look back on older media depictions of â€œthe futureâ€ â€” many of these depictions feature flying cars but, could not predict the internet. I suspect that any attempt to paint a picture of our technological future may end up looking just as funny when we look back on it.----The StartupMarketing Strategist and Content Developer focused on organizations and people leading the changing social landscape.

All thanks to technology.Can you imagine life without the internet today? I canâ€™t. Weâ€™re living in the age of the digital consumer, and itâ€™s not just me saying this. There are more than 4 billion active online users. India alone has >463 million. One industry thatâ€™s seen the true impact of this digital disruption is Media and Entertainment.The Indian M&E sector has seen a CAGR of 13% last year, and is expected to cross Rs. 2 million by 2020. Thatâ€™s massive! More than 1.5 million users have completely shifted to digital media, and donâ€™t use traditional media anymore. Smartphones have been a key driving force in this scenario. While we have approximately 405 million smartphone users today, the number is expected to cross 805 million in the next two years. Private equity investments in media and entertainment worth $115 million were made in 2018, and investments in networks and spectrums have surpassed $20 billion. The numbers speak for themselves.Itâ€™s all connected!20 years ago, the concept of a digitally connected, online world seemed unreal. The usage of the World Wide Web was limited to 5% of the total population. Not anymore. New media has successfully overtaken the traditional, and this includes everything from entertainment portals and video games to the way we communicate. All thanks to technology.I canâ€™t imagine a world without IoT powered devices. Weâ€™ve come a long way, from struggling for the Doordarshan news, to binge watching movies at ease; from painfully slow dial-up connections to super-fast Wi-Fi. Thereâ€™s an app for everything! Smart TVs are quite popular now, thanks to the massesâ€™ rising disposable incomes and a shift towards premium lifestyles. Most middle class families own at least one of these. According to Deloitte, Indian users spend 17% of their total screen time on entertainment. With cross platform integration, gaming consoles can also plug you in to Netlflix, Prime, Hulu and Hotstar. Can you imagine the amount of content that is?Shifting consumer preferences in a tech-enabled landscapeDigital content is king now, especially for millennial audiences. The internet started out as the voice of the people, and now, thanks to the constant stream of technological disruption thatâ€™s proliferated, itâ€™s gone a step ahead. Every person is their own media entity, thanks to social media platforms that enable public storytelling. Tech has successfully transformed the process of content creation, the role of the publisher and the control over this content. Affordable data and 4G networks have had huge role to play. New media works because it is immediate, enabling and convenient. Everything happens at the touch of a buttonMore and more people are embracing regional content as well, and thatâ€™s another opportunity to tap into. Thereâ€™s been a vast shift in consumer attitudes as well, and people are more focused on easily accessible content libraries rather than ownership. The cloud has been the biggest boon for media & entertainment in this respect. Take the Netflix example, and their move from a DVD based business to a digital library. Itâ€™s not just entertainment. Count Music in. Most consumers have embraced music streaming rather than downloading, and Spotify launching in India is the best example. It crossed a million users in less than a week! Pretty awesome, if you ask me.What next?Itâ€™s not all a bed of roses. Within India, challenges like content piracy and slow internet speeds are the biggest hurdles for digital content and media. Cord cutting is far from becoming a reality, at least right now. But weâ€™re in a good place. We must not forget how lucky we are to be living and breathing this disruptive change, and how monumental it is. User generated content means only one thing: more data. And thatâ€™s the only thing more valuable than gold, or even oil right now. Digital content led platforms give businesses and organisations the chance to gather insights through this data. Especially when consumers portray different personalities on different platforms. The perception of TV as the main entertainment device for families and individuals has already been altered, as consumers gravitate towards personalized content on multiple screens. Customisation is key.Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are also going to be crucial going ahead, since consumers are actively using voice assistants to make content choices. What does the future look like? To me, itâ€™s a community of people coming together to create engaging content in real time, a time where interactive streaming (like Netflixâ€™s Bandersnatch) is not a once-in-a-while phenomenon. Itâ€™s time to move from cable to cloud, and I, personally canâ€™t wait!----Josh SoftwareRubyist, Gopher, Entrepreneur, Author, Co-founder & Director at http://www.joshsoftware.com.

Blockchain offers a wide range of applications including trade finance settlements, supply chain management, digital identity, and contract law.However, blockchain systems donâ€™t currently offer the functionality of a versatile operating system. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that have forked from it are single-use applications. Distributed application platforms such as Ethereum have attempted to replicate the features of an operating system but with some serious limitations.These limitations include speed, security, and a lack of capability to customize according to various specific business needs. For this reason, many businesses are reluctant to leverage the benefits of decentralized public blockchains, opting instead for permissioned distributed ledgers. This is not to say that blockchain technology is something to terrify them, but they are treating it with caution.Consider that up until the time Microsoft developed Windows, everyday businesses didnâ€™t use computers for tasks like word processing. Once operating systems became available and increasingly user-friendly, commercial adoption of computers and therefore applications started to increase. Developers started creating more apps that served specific purposes, adapted for different business needs.Blockchain is facing a similar issue as pre-OS computers. With no operating system that can adapt for use by many different types of businesses, the technology has so far failed to achieve widespread commercial adoption. Business needs vary too widely to make a single blockchain fit for all purposes.For example, trade finance doesnâ€™t need instant settlements if legal and data privacy requirements canâ€™t be maintained. Retailers need to meet peaks in demand during shopping holidays like Black Friday. Existing blockchain infrastructure cannot meet these conflicting demands without compromising one for the other.Aelf seeks to overcome these problems with a customizable blockchain ecosystem that is fully interoperable and therefore suitable for commercial use â€” a Linux for blockchain. We provide the core system, solving issues including governance for system updates, transaction speed, scalability, and interoperability.Developers can then use the aelf kernel to create customizable sidechains for specific business or commercial needs. Aelf will also allow each sidechain to interact with each other as well as other blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, thereby allowing assets, users and information to be shared between different applications.To achieve interoperability, aelf uses two innovative features. Sidechains bring scalability through separation of resources and smart contract functionality. Alongside this, the delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) protocol provides an adaptable governance system with fast transaction confirmations.Aelf doesnâ€™t operate on a one-size-fits-all blockchain concept. Instead, the system runs on a main chain backbone, with branched sidechains connected to the main chain by an indexing system. The indexing system recognizes two types of sidechains:â€¢ External chains of high importance, such as Bitcoin or Ethereumâ€¢ Internal sidechainsThe main chain doesnâ€™t hold any smart contracts. Smart contracts are developed on internal sidechains, with each sidechain serving a specific type of smart contract functionality and/or business need.For instance, one sidechain may act as a digital asset exchange, whereas another might handle asset storage as a digital wallet. If the digital asset exchange sidechain becomes too heavy, it can be branched off into sub-chains which handle different types of digital assets.Sidechains can only interact with one another via the main chain. In this way, if one sidechain is experiencing any peaks or bottlenecks, the rest of the system is unaffected.Read more about Sidechains vs. Sharding.Indexing multiple sidechains on the main chain is more complicated than typical transaction confirmation on a blockchain like Bitcoin. In addition, aelf is designed to provide enterprise cloud services in a more complex structure.Therefore, proof of work or proof of stake arenâ€™t suitable, so the main aelf blockchain uses the DPoS protocol. DPoS offers the dual advantages of being both faster and more predictable than PoW or PoS, while still ensuring high levels of security are adhered to.In DPoS, ELF token holders elect mining nodes. The mining nodes enforce all rules of aelf and decide how to distribute mining rewards. Sidechains are free to adopt their own consensus protocol but are encouraged to merge mining with the aelf main chain.Aelf token holders delegate 2N+1 mining nodes, where N starts with 8 and increases by 1 each year. Unlike the traditional setup, each node will consist of a cluster of computers split into two clusters, one for processing transactions and one for database storage.Read more about why aelf chose DPoS.Sidechains are charged a transaction fee in ELF tokens, which is determined relative to the contribution of the sidechain to the overall aelf ecosystem. Therefore, the biggest contributors pay the least fees.As sidechains transact, mining nodes on the main chain read information coming in from the sidechains, forming a Merkle Tree. Each block on the main chain then records the Merkle Tree roots in the block header. If a sidechain needs to communicate with another sidechain, they can do so via the main chain by including the main chain block header.Sidechains can vote within their own branch to index other sub-chains. Sub-chains can request to be indexed by more than one sidechain if they wish. Sidechains can also charge fees of any sub-chains branching off from them.With a fully interoperable blockchain ecosystem, aelf offers a variety of potential business use cases that are unrestrained by many of the challenges facing users of other blockchain infrastructure. These include financial services, digital identity, smart city, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Existing dApps built on Ethereum, EOS or other platforms can interact with aelf applications, and companies wishing to participate in the aelf ecosystem have the opportunity to start small and scale as much as they wish.You can read more about the technical aspects of aelf in our whitepaper.â€” Join the Community:Â· Get on our Telegram Discord Slack and Kakao channelÂ· Follow us on Twitter Reddit and FacebookÂ· Read weekly articles on the aelf blogÂ· Catch up with the develop progress on GithubÂ· Telegram community in í•œêµ­ ,æ—¥æœ¬èªž ,Ñ€ÑƒÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ ,Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø±Ø¨ÙŠØ© ,Deutsch ,ItalianoandTiáº¿ng Viá»‡t,Â· Instagram: aelfblockchainÂ· YouTube Channel: aelfFor more information, visit aelf.io----aelfHead of Content Creation & Community Engagement for aelf.

To succeed in the competitive job market, it is crucial for them to adopt a proactive approach when it comes to brand identity and corporate. Hence, to attract the best talent, they have to continuously innovate and enhance their employer brand by highlighting organizational mission, vision, and objectives.The adoption of robust technology can enable organizations to build a compelling employer brand. As both employers and candidates compete to stand out in the marketplace, the demand for practical solutions is always rising. Rather than the employer selecting the candidates, the top talent chooses their employers.Organizations can attract talent through incentives and employer engagement schemes, along with ethical workplace culture, values, and social outlook. However, they will need to have a robust employer branding strategy in place. It involves defining employee benefits across a range of channels. Technology can facilitate the platform for building and marketing the employee brand.Establishing a careers page will enable employers to demonstrate the value they place on top talent. Organizations can share the experiences of current employees, giving the candidates a glimpse of the workplace culture. They can promote their philosophies and attract new talent.

Luego se pliega en un telÃ©fono. Si bien es solo un prototipo, es un ejemplo de una tendencia que es probable que ocurra en los prÃ³ximos aÃ±os, a medida que los fabricantes de dispositivos populares comienzan a vender productos con pantallas plegables.CompruÃ©belo usted mismo:El dispositivo Xiaomi, como se puede ver en el video de arriba, que se publicÃ³ en las redes sociales de Xiaomi y luego se publicÃ³ en YouTube por The Verge, al principio parece una tableta normal. Pero, mÃ¡s adelante en el clip, la tableta se dobla en tercios, con los lados izquierdo y derecho doblados detrÃ¡s del centro. La tableta de repente se vuelve del tamaÃ±o de un telÃ©fono celular grande, un factor de forma que tiene sentido para algunas cosas en las que una tableta no funciona bien, como hacer llamadas telefÃ³nicas.Xiaomi no es la Ãºnica empresa que aprovecha los avances en tecnologÃ­a de pantallas.medium.comLG en el CES 2019 presentÃ³ un televisor que se puede enrollar completamente cuando no lo estÃ¡s viendo. Samsung tambiÃ©n revelÃ³ recientemente un prototipo de telÃ©fono que puede desarrollarse en un dispositivo mÃ¡s grande, similar a una tableta. PrometiÃ³ que el nuevo telÃ©fono â€œllegarÃ¡ prontoâ€. Los rumores han sugerido durante mucho tiempo que Microsoft ha estado trabajando en un producto de Surface que se puede plegar a la mitad. Apple no ha hablado pÃºblicamente sobre los planes para un dispositivo de plegado, pero ha obtenido de Samsung sus pantallas de iPhone, lo que significa que la tecnologÃ­a estÃ¡ lista si lo desea.www.cnbc.comEl software tambiÃ©n estÃ¡ listo.Los sistemas operativos que se ejecutan en estos nuevos productos deberÃ¡n saber quÃ© hacer cuando un usuario lo doble por la mitad. El sistema operativo Android de Google comenzÃ³ oficialmente a admitir dispositivos plegables en noviembre, cuando Samsung revelÃ³ su prototipo.â€œSimplemente puede desplegar el dispositivo para obtener una pantalla mÃ¡s grande para tabletas. A medida que se desarrolla, la aplicaciÃ³n se transfiere a la pantalla mÃ¡s grande sin perder el ritmo â€œ, dijo en ese momento el vicepresidente de ingenierÃ­a de Android, Dave Burke.Mientras tanto, The Verge dijo a principios de este mes que Microsoft ha estado construyendo soporte para pantallas plegables en Windows. El Wall Street Journal informÃ³ la semana pasada que Motorola planea relanzar el telÃ©fono Razr como un dispositivo plegable.Y, sin embargo, todavÃ­a estamos esperando dispositivos listos para el consumidor que podamos comprar. Las noticias en ese frente pueden estar a la vuelta de la esquina.En el Mobile World Congress en febrero, donde muchas empresas normalmente presentan nuevos telÃ©fonos inteligentes para el mercado global, es probable que veamos avances en productos plegables.

To support the companyâ€™s exponential growth, The Starâ€™s Group Procurement function needed to develop a simple, intuitive buying platform that can scale with projected demand and cater to the growing workforce.I led the project team, as the service designer, alongside a technical lead and web designer, to develop a SharePoint-based intranet portal â€” How To Buy. How To Buy steps staff through The Starâ€™s end-to-end buying processes and channels, so that they can be confident that they are buying the right thing, in the right way, at the right price.45 user interviews, 5 design studios, 7 prototypes and 15 user tests.Problem statement, user interviews, personas, journey mapping, service design blueprint, Microsoft SharePoint, prototyping, user testing, project management, change management and communications.I think How To Buy is really easy to use. Well done on setting this up, it will work well for me.â€” Kylie Javier, Momofuku General Manager, 2019 Winner of the Good Food Guide Service Excellence AwardWhen we set out to build How To Buy, we decided to use an agile, iterative prototyping approach. We started by interviewing a range of users, from within the Procurement team as well as a broad representation of stakeholders from across the company. We also shadowed a few buyers at their workplaces, whether it was at the delivery dock or kitchen storage, to better understand their current ways of working including the tools, interactions and workarounds.As a result of the discovery, we came up with three key design principles for How To Buy:#1 Easy search â€” Quickly find what they need â€œAmazon-styleâ€ by selecting the relevant item category via an intuitive, user-friendly portal;#2 Buy right â€” How To Buy guides them on how to buy right, directing them to The Starâ€™s online catalogues and vetted suppliers; and#3 Improved support â€” A single place for them to learn about when and how to work with Procurement and where to go for help.We mocked up the first screen designs in PowerPoint and then SharePoint, as both were mediums that project participants, unfamiliar with conventional design tools, could provide feedback quickly. We tested the mock-ups with users by tasking them with a use case, all the while observing their reactions, clarifying why they performed certain actions and seeking feedback for improvement. From this, we were able to iterate our prototypes, ensuring that we captured the critical journeys but also, designing a user-friendly, technically viable solution that was in line with the businessâ€™ requirements.The user testing sessions were most useful for us to meet and to identify with our users. We invited key stakeholders from the business to be part of the creative process and by listening and engaging with them, we were able to design the portal for our users in mind, and not just for ourselves. This early engagement with this initial group of users also helped to position them as early adopters, and therefore, positioning them as change champions when we rolled out How To Buy.This goodwill was further augmented by a range of change and communications activities, including a marketing campaign on multiple communication channels, face-to-face information sessions, customer satisfaction surveys and customer journey interviews â€” all with the sole purpose of giving our stakeholders the confidence to use How To Buy.Great for training new staff on procurement processes.Mark Coddington, IT Enterprise Services ManagerOne of the main obstacles that we had to overcome during the project was the lack of consistency in the way The Starâ€™s buying processes were being applied by one person to next. Through iterative testing with multiple users, we were able to triangulate their feedback and incrementally improve on our prototypes with every testing session.Another obstacle that we encountered was item category classifications and labels, which we discovered through user testing, was a source of confusion for many users. While the procurement team adhered by strict category definitions, to ensure consistency in data protocols, the terminology and classification hierarchy were not intuitive to non-procurement users. Again, we tested and retested this with users, in order to build a shared language that served as the basis to streamline the buying processes while improving usability and user adoption.An iterative approach to prototyping, testing and building early and often, especially since we were a small team working to a limited budget, enabled us to do a lot with little, in a rapid, cost-effective and user-friendly fashion.Since How To Buy was launched in July 2018, there has been a significant increase in user engagement. Monthly site traffic by unique visitors and page views have both doubled, which indicates that visitors are spending more time on the site and are actively engaging with the content.When we surveyed visitors about their overall experience with How To Buy, they gave us a resounding 4.5 / 5 star rating, on average. 89% of those surveyed told us that they found what they were looking for on How To Buy, and even if they had not found what they were looking for, all knew exactly where to go for additional support.My project team won The Star Corporate Excellence Award for How To Buy, and to top it all off, our efforts were recognised by the industry, when we were awarded the 2018 Procurement and Supply Australasia (PASA) Award for Most Improved Customer Experience.Love this project?

This tweaked the market forceâ€™s dynamic but at the same time increased broadcaster value.Before Pay-TV, broadcasters usually financed/monetized their operation through a mix of advertisement revenue and, in some countries, especially in Europe, with governmental funds. This was due to the fact that Free-To-Air television was seen by several governments as a public commodity.With the emergence of Pay-TV in the 1980/90â€™s, despite some changes in market dynamics which converged in the user now having more choices and a broader offer spectrum from cable networks, the truth is that broadcasters are not only staying relevant with a premium content strategy, especially sports and first runs, but also with a new revenue stream that didnâ€™t exist in the past â€” the Pay-TV carrying fees to rebroadcast their content.However, even with more content being offered by Pay-TV in the last 30 years, its relationship with broadcasters is perfectly peaceful, with broadcaster position and brand value remaining untouched.So, why does this happen? Well, several factors come into play:1) The entry barriers are still high; a public broadcaster license is expensive and it is usually obtained by a public tender that only happens once or twice per decade.2) There are no real competitor issues; the number of broadcast TV competitors is limited due to an also limited number of frequencies available and these are restricted by public bodies. So, different broadcasters need to compete between themselves in a controlled environment. Naturally, the digitalization at the beginning of the 21st century opened space in some countries for broader licenses and frequency concessions, making it harder, in some cases, for Pay-TV penetration. This happens because it is now also possible to offer niche channels over the traditional broadcasting method and, in some counties, it makes competition with broadcasters more aggressive, affecting broadcaster profitability. A good example of this scenario can be seen in Spain. Despite all this, the linear TV consumption time is still growing and broadcasters continue having a growing number of views and advertisement revenues.3) Up until recently, broadcasters preferred vehicles used by advertising agencies in order to reach bigger audiences and mitigate the problem of double spending while reaching the same users. The logic behind it was that if they used niche Pay-TV channels, despite a lower cost-per-million views they would probably not reach their target audience with the same ease than a broadcaster, however, if they use both, they will most likely be paying double to reach some users. So the optimization of budgetary expenses was also an essential advantage that broadcasters had in the past in order to stay relevant and have significant revenues from advertisement.What is changing?The Television industry, and naturally broadcasters, are starting to face what is most probably the emergence of the most disruptive movement in the television history, a hypercompetitive environment that incumbent players will certainly have problems to control or even be a relevant part of. In my (and major industry studies) opinion, there are five key forces decisively contributing to it:1) High-Speed internet proliferation across the globe.2) The deregulation and liberalization of internet usage allowed for new competitors to enter the production and distribution associated to new business models (for example, the Amazon business model relies upon a totally different model than classic industry players).3) Online content availability increased, not only in quantity but in quality. Certainly Youtube, Netflix, Vimeo, and millions of other websites and online video platforms are contributing to this offer growth, making it available to users at any given moment.4) The surfacing of cheaper content producing models, leading to more user-generated content that is not only highly appreciated by other users but can also be directly available to them by OTT platforms and without any content distributor, TV content aggregator or broadcaster intermediation.5) A change in the way people are consuming video. We are witnessing three important viewing displacements that also impact broadcasters:Some factors are clearly having a negative impact on the current broadcastersâ€™ business model, and the majority of that negative impact comes from relationship shifts in the value chain power:First of all, content producers/aggregators have much more bargaining power than ever, as content is increasingly more important and there is a steady growth on the demand for quality content. In the same way, premium sports are forcing broadcasters to make an additional effort to buy premium content.Second thing and, in my opinion, the most important, is that â€œshelf spaceâ€ on the internet is unrestricted by the number of channels that are traditionally limited by satellite bandwidth or terrestrial and cable frequencies. Now, users can watch multiple content without the TV programming experience. This change puts the user at the center of the value chain, and now itâ€™s the user who decides what, when and where to watch. This impacts, at first glance, on the channeling of advertisement investment, but it also affects which content is most likely to be watched. In short, what evidence is telling us is that high-value quality content and niche content is more watched and that commercial dramas and movies are being less watched, the content that is mainly driven by broadcasters to fill their programmatic space between news and premium sports, maybe even the occasional premium blockbuster premiere. This reduces userâ€™s appetite for broadcaster content in certain periods of the day to the detriment of other content available on different OTT platforms.The third significant change, and directly related to new user habits regardless of video consumption, is that advertisement money is flowing towards online video. Although television is still seen as the most effective advertising medium in the goal to reach mass-audiences in major national/global markets, online video advertising is percentage wise a double-digit growing category with a double-digit yearly growth all over the world. Todayâ€™s broadcaster revenues are still steady or, at most, facing a slow reduction, but this scenario brings them more vulnerability when facing Internet video consumption growth and macroeconomic fluctuations since it will put these expenses on the top advertising agenciesâ€™ lists to be reduced or even cut. Fourth, and also related to user habit changes, we have the diffusion/dilution of the means, the platforms and the screens where users can watch content. This also contributes to the dilution of the broadcasterâ€™s brand, making it harder for users to remember it from the get-go.Not directly related to the value chain but with an industry change, the Cord-Cutting or Cord-Shaving phenomenon that we are now witnessing on some Pay-TV markets, where users cancel their Pay-TV subscriptions or reduce it to a more basic subscription package, can also impact broadcasters in two ways:The dynamics that we currently see in other sectors of the entertainment industry are now moving towards the video. This happened later than audio and books for two main reasons: the habit of linear TV consumption and video being more demanding in terms of high-speed connection.However, despite the late take-off, I truly believe the intensity will be considerably bigger because video is by far the most consumed media and with the most advertisement investment, making its industry value significantly higher.In order to create a solid analysis of different scenarios, I will use a classic analysis framework with two critical vectors: premium content and the capability of content owners to directly reach users. Certainly, we could consider other vectors such as the capability to move faster on live news, the capability to create niche content (niches with favorable budgets), just to name a few strong potential vectors when considering other players in the Industry ecosystem. However, we understand that for the mainstream market the ones chosen are much more relevant.So, with those vectors in mind, we can draw four potential scenarios that can help broadcasters to create their conceptual framework and define their strategy on this dynamic hypercompetitive environment.Naturally, this scenario adoption or mutation will vary geographically and in the time, but we believe it will certainly help strategic managers on their decisions.Scenario 1: A Gradual evolution within the current television industry structureIn this scenario, Pay-TV and broadcasters are cohabiting perfectly with OTT without any disruptive changes. The premium content is still distributed by them using the current market and some part goes online with Netflix, Amazon and YouTube conquering a piece of the pie but not harming the relative importance of these players in the industry. Even if they eventually reach agreements with the streaming platforms to host content owned by broadcasters (the European regulation forcing platforms to have at least 20% of locally produced content will certainly help).Internet platforms are one more vehicle for broadcasters to place some of their content and one more channel to reach their audience.This scenario represents the status quo, the maintenance in relative positions towards market incumbents, with a small part eroded by a potential relationship with online video platforms. But in this scenario, the broadcasterâ€™s brand value stays on top of userâ€™s minds, the content, especially sports, will tend to be bought and aired using the broadcasterâ€™s channels (by air, cable or Internet), and the number of hours watched by the average viewer will remain steady as will the advertisement revenue, with a small negative outlook.This will remain an important scenario in the places where international content is not that popular and broadband penetration is not that high, but certainly, it is not a long-term scenario, we see it as a transitional situation for some markets.In this case, the broadcaster has the space for a defensive approach or even to expand its market share.Scenario 2: Multiple Platform content spread and competition for viewer loyaltyThis scenario tends to be adopted much faster at more mature markets, where broadband connections have higher coverage, the ARPUs are relatively high and users are considerably active over multiple video platforms, consuming video from different sources.When it comes to the broadcaster value chain, it maintains the same workflow. Content is bought from distributors or creators and, in turn, gets monetized through carrying fees and advertisement. Content owners drastically increase their bargain power from that point on since they donâ€™t really need broadcaster (neither Pay-TV operators) channels to reach their audience, especially creators with a strong established follower base.This scenario clearly attacks the current status quo of the typical broadcaster. First up, because the channel lineup in the whole programmatic TV scheme loses its key value and, consequently, induces a loss of brand loyalty and positioning with an audience, massively leading it to consume on-demand content (with the exception of live TV â€” news/sports/events). Secondly, despite the content diversification that broadcasters might not be used to, derived from physical or governmental constraints, the content format that broadcasters are used to pack is designed for mid-roll advertisement and it is not competitive within online video ecosystem, one that is dominated by short duration videos (the fastest growing content segment in online video), diminishing the broadcasterâ€™s strength when competing at a pure online on-demand level.Scenario 3: Owner distribution monetization of big events and premium content through a direct-to-consumer approachIn this scenario, the owners of valuable content, especially live events, decide to monetize their content directly to the consumer. Some parallels can be found in what happened with the music industry. Compared with the previous scenario, it is even more aggressive for broadcasters, since the most important and interesting content that a broadcaster can acquire in order to diversify and win audience share is live content and, in this case, the content is solely explored by the content owner with no intermediaries, potentially causing an even bigger brand dilution towards the user.Despite how plausible this scenario looks on paper, especially for on-demand content, we donâ€™t believe it will be a realistic mainstream scenario for the next 5 years, even on mature and high broadband penetration markets. There are a few reasons leading us to this opinion:So this is a high-risk scenario for content owners, the risk being that at the end of the day all players could potentially end up losing.Scenario 4: MVPDs (Multichannel Video Programming Distributors) and Virtual MVPDs fighting for premium contentIn this scenario, in order to answer the Cord-Cutting tendency, MVPDs aggressively fight with each other for exclusive distribution rights over premium content.This would make content very expensive for broadcasters, but on the other hand, MVPDs would simply be defending their core and their traditional business. This case is more in line with scenario 1, as the broadcaster needs to have some flexibility over carrying fees to keep a relationship with the MVPDs because they would be paying more for premium content not having any space for increase their fees. This would put off some broadcasters and TV channels since the bundles would inevitably be skinny.This case is the less harmful for broadcasters since they would increase their revenue stream from advertisement and, as long as MVPDs can guarantee a certain audience reach, at the very most, they would offer a very aggressive and comfortable carrying fee structure to MVPDs.However, in this scenario, the online video platforms and content diffusion would not disappear and its intensity would be controlled because of MVPDs fighting back, but the video consumption trends for non-premium content would remain. In short, scenario 1 is the one focusing more on MVPDs directly fighting for content.In our opinion, this scenario (4) is the most relevant in more mature markets all across the globe, itâ€™s already starting to happen. The broadcaster should clearly consider it on their defensive strategies.I firmly believe that we are witnessing one of the biggest revolutions in television industry. It is only natural, in a world of where digitalization and the internet can provide a fragmentation, not only of which channels we watch, but also when and where we watch it, directly affecting the current broadcaster business model.The essence of this article is to serve as a tool to guide broadcaster decision makers on their strategy design and provide counseling on path and alliances to follow. There is no doubt that they should make an extra effort to stay competitive and relevant for viewers.Based on the four scenarios, we can draw the first considerations and suggestions, however, we should understand that internet online video platforms, user-generated content or on-demand video consumption will not disappear and are not likely to change any time soon. Broadcasters and Pay-TV operators cannot leave the past behind, but they can adapt their strategy to this new environment.Nevertheless, we shouldnâ€™t only focus on problems and threats. There are also new opportunities to take advantage of, like the vast potential of online video advertisement space, or previous strengths to be leveraged such as brand image and content reputation, that have been built over decades of know-how entertaining their audience.In my understanding, broadcasters have the following strategies to consider when attacking the market and acquiring better success odds:a) Control content production and content costs with a vertical integration strategy. This means, acquiring or creating content production houses with three main goals:b) The second available strategic option, with particular relevance for scenarios 2 and 3 is the co-opetition strategy. In an article written for the International Journal of Digital Television[1], Evans defines particularly well the fundamentals of this strategy. It starts from understanding how collaboration between close competitors may be an opportunity for revenue and survival in turbulent times, having the maximization of revenue from advertisement as the main goal and taking maximum advantage of the digital world. This strategy looks to improve the advertisement revenue with hyper-personalization but it admits that a broadcaster alone doesnâ€™t have enough catalog relevancy or the depth to be relevant in a streaming application. Therefore, co-opetition between several broadcasters will be incredibly relevant, at least at a local level. Some examples of this course of action are Hulu in the USA, YouView in the UK and Maxdone in Germany.c) Another interesting strategic option would be an international cooperation strategy between multiple broadcasters, in order to compete for multi-territory advertising deals with their digital inventory. The two main goals here are to create synergies in a non-competitive environment between broadcasters from different countries (German ProSieben is not likely to compete with Portuguese TVI) and working together to compete with Facebook and Google on an international level. This way, all the parties involved can enjoy each otherâ€™s brand reputation and assure content value, as well as a multiple language inventory specific for each country, defining a Global Strategy. RTL AdConnect is a good example of this strategy.d) A fourth one can be a local content and/or niche-based strategy and distribution across multiple online video platforms, developing a niche portfolio and leveraging the current brand power to be an authority in a particular segment. This could be an exciting strategy, especially when you donâ€™t have deep pockets to buy premium content or a broader national audience to monetize it. Niche segments canâ€™t always be perceived as a particular content category in terms of genre, as well as regional content such as local events or sports.When broadcasters pick this strategy they need to be careful on how they can differentiate themselves from user-generated content since their brand value can get trapped and even more diluted. Moreover, when choosing this strategy, broadcasters need to make their content available, not only across their TV Everywhere app but also across other platforms such as Youtube, iTunes, etc. The Food Network and ABC in the USA are two good examples of this strategy.As we have stated at the beginning of this article, there are no â€œone size fits allâ€ solutions. WeTek and I are always researching and connecting the dots in this ever-changing industry, becoming aware of its mutations but also making sure that we have the proper tools to help broadcasters navigate through them with maximum profit.One thing needs to be cleared from the get-go, broadcasters are still relevant and will continue to be, as long as the right decisions are made and the tools needed are known to them.Hugo Condesa, WeTek CEO[1] Evens, T.1 (2014).

44,45881,https://medium.com/@chrishtopher.henry_38679/trends-in-food-packaging-b7684b1436b2?source=tag_archive---------170-----------------------,Trends In Food Packaging,None,Christopher,https://medium.com/,4,0,3,"ChristopherFollow--ListenShareFood packaging is a highly competitive and vibrant industry that is always on the lookout for new trends and innovations aiming to ease the life of consumers. Food packaging not only markets the product but also increases the shelf life of the products. Here are some of the main trends of the food packaging trends that are visible today.1.Food Packaging: To Choose Thermal or Direct Transfer Labeling:Food-related emissions make up 21 percent of total emissions in America, of which the packaging and supply chain mechanisms contribute 11 percent, reports a study conducted in 2010. Whereas the same carried out in 2018 suggests that on an average, the production and supply of food account for 83 percent of emissions, while only the packaging accounts for 11 percent. A decade ago, this category would not have been critically important. However, at present is needs the utmost attention. Waste reduction and lower carbon footprints are majorly gaining part in producers and Food packaging companiesâ€™ mission statements and, in many cases, used to strengthen competitive advantage.Many companies have used direct thermal labeling traditionally as a niche technology across various narrow vertical markets, including dairy, meat, and poultry. However, developments in thermal paper technology have resulted in a wide range of products that are suitable for utilization in many applications across nearly any vertical market. The result has led to increased interest in direct thermal as the technology option for new or upgraded applications.The primary difference between direct thermal and thermal transfer printing is that thermal transfer printing uses a thermal ribbon and direct thermal printing does not. Thermal ribbon uses a poly-based carrier made from crude oil products. Eliminating its use can, therefore, positively impact a companyâ€™s goal for a reduced carbon footprint. After the ribbon is used, the spent ribbon and cores must be disposed of; it flows out to the companyâ€™s waste stream.The thermal transfer involves the thermal printhead elements heating one side of a thermal transfer ribbon to melt it. This will allow the compound on the other side to stick to the label material, thus creating the printed image.Direct thermal printing needs a heat-sensitive label material. The printhead elements are in direct contact with the heat-sensitive material enabling the elements to effect a color change in the material. Direct thermal technology brings to halt the usage of thermal ribbons, eliminating the excess generation of waste. The advances in direct thermal materials and technology expand the potential use applications. The above-listed considerations will be given extra attention in organizations with the freedom to choose the technology.2.5 Futuristic Technologies that will Transform the Food Packaging IndustryThe rapid digitization of the world has practically changed everything. No wonder, these technologies have enhanced the level of food packaging. From â€˜electronic tonguesâ€™ that have the ability to taste the products to the nanoparticles that constantly fight bacteria which are 50,000 times thinner than human hair, researchers and scientists are exploring innovations of food safety.Following is a rundown of some of the technologies that wonâ€™t shield the food from harmful bacteria but will also change the way the food and beverage vendors operate.1. Micro PackingA team of researchers at Texas A&M University has developed a â€˜micro-filmâ€™ that can be the next miracle in the food packaging field. The material comprises solely of water, soluble polymer, and 70 percent clay particles. The packaging is considered to be eco-friendly as compared to plastic as well as possess the preservation features of glass that can hold the fizz better in soda.Durethan, a plastic film developed by Bayer, which is a chemical and pharmaceutical organization, prevents moisture, carbon dioxide, and oxygen from decomposing food products. Likewise, Nanocore has developed nanocrystal-embedded plastic that doesnâ€™t let the oxygen escape from beer bottles.2. Edible PackagingAs per the scientists and industry experts, people will eat dinner along with its packaging instead of throwing it into the trash bin. Isnâ€™t it shocking? Recently, a research team at Harvard University developed multiple edible food containers named WikiCells. The teamâ€™s inventions include lemon juice contained in a lemon membrane, pumpkin soup in spinach membrane and melted chocolate contained in a cherry membrane. People in Japan are already having edible rice paper-wrapped candy called Bontan Anne.Source Link :Food and beverages----I am a technology blogger, who loves to read and write on the latest in technology.Christopher--Christopher--Christopher--ChristopherinTechnology Innovations--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Robert Roy Britt--12HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Check out part 1 here.2. Services as a ServiceAt its heart, a delivery service removes the need to go out and bring something home. But what about services that already require someone to come pay a visit to the house? Think handymen, or snow removal; these providers need transportation, and Uber can provide that of course â€” Uber for Business is a great solution for service businesses to scale without having their own fleet of vehicles at the ready â€” but more powerfully Uber can connect customers with professionals in their area who make house calls.Go-Jek does this already in Indonesia with particular industries, including auto repair, house cleaning, massages, and beauty services. It has been very deliberate in expanding carefully to particular industries, putting a lot of thought and diligence into its offerings, making sure that their network of service providers is licensed, vetted, and trustworthy before allowing users to summon them into their homes.Uber could expand to these services as well, and even beyond. Why not use the app to call for a landscaper to come and spruce up the front yard or mow the lawn the day itâ€™s needed? Or find a mechanic to come make a minor car repair in your driveway? Why not be able to call a chiropractor to come check up on you at home when your back makes it impossible to go anywhere? The end game is to provide a one stop shop for anything: Uber becomes the portal through which to order any item or service to your home. Over time, even businesses that didnâ€™t realize they were in the at-home service category could take advantage of Uberâ€™s demand aggregation.Uber could further build out the platform by allowing a uniform interface for businesses to be able to schedule their services through the app as well. For customers itâ€™s easy, not just because of a shared interface across a range of services available, but also for the fact that they can control all sorts of appointments from their Uber app, from when someone will come to help assemble furniture to when a doctor will visit an elderly parent, to of course when someone will pick them up to take them somewhere. The breadth of offerings, the quality of services, and the overall ease of use will be the winning factors here for consumers. If gotten right, they will trigger a positive growth cycle for this sector of Uberâ€™s business.On demand at-home services exist today, but they are fragmented. Wrench for instance sends you a car mechanic at home, Clutter sends someone to take things into storage for you (giving new meaning to Storage as a Service), and perhaps most famously TaskRabbit provides a platform for freelancers who make house calls to offer a multitude of services. But Uberâ€™s scale puts it in a unique position to aggregate a lot of these services, so users can access all of them through one app rather than having to install one for each type of service. This also helps with discoverability, as users looking for one type of service on Uber can strategically be introduced to other types of services they might enjoy. Through a series of strategic acquisitions and partnerships, Uber can make itself into a platform for such services, and pool a lot of the backend logistics as well to streamline across different services (a cleaning van could make a food delivery on its way to someoneâ€™s house, for instance).The key thing for Uber when expanding to services that have an in-home component is to build with safety and security in mind. This is no foreign concept to Uber; ten years ago the notion that we would jump into strangersâ€™ cars with barely an exchange or even a glance at their license plate would have been unfathomable, and yet today it is a normal part of modern, urban life. But as Uber begins to build itself into a Services as a Service platform, it will need to be deliberate and mindful in its expansion to ensure that there are checks and protections for both customers as well as service providers.A popular template for startups is to describe themselves as being the â€œUber for Xâ€, and there are lists of businesses that fit the model. By building out the delivery and services platform, Uber can become the Uber for anything. If executed correctly, this is a huge opportunity for Uber to diversify itself beyond the profit constraints of vanilla rideshareing.3. Payments platformFor all of these businesses that Uber will become a platform for, Uber also becomes the default payments processor. This already happens for restaurants and drivers who donâ€™t collect money from their customers directly, but rather from Uber. Itâ€™s not a stretch for Uber to invest a little more into building out its payments platform and begin to compete with the likes of Stripe and Paypal. It could commoditize its payments platform, and price it to be competitive with current market players. For delivery and service businesses that do a lot of business on Uber, it might make sense to consolidate to Uberâ€™s payments across the board; for others, it will come down to a cost-benefit decision, which Uber can compete on like every other payments platform does.Uber also has a really interesting opportunity to become a force in the consumer payments space. Uber is already doing some interesting work here; the recent rollout of the Uber Gold rewards program is reminiscent of what credit card companies do with their miles and points schemes. Granted Uberâ€™s rewards arenâ€™t anything to write home about (somewhere between 1% and 4% back depending on the spending combination between UberX, UberPool, and UberEats), they still indicate that Uber wants to use points to keep customers incentivized to stick with Uber rather than jump between it and its competitors. Uber also offers a credit card with decent cash back rewards, offering another way for frequent riders (and in this case, restaurant and UberEats frequenters), to get rewarded for their loyalties.Uberâ€™s strongest foray into this space however is through UberCash, whereby Uber incentivizes users to load up their accounts with money to spend on Uberâ€™s offerings. If Uberâ€™s product offerings start to expand rapidly as discussed above and it continues to incentivize usage of UberCash with its discounts and special offers, Uber could very well maneuver its way into becoming a strong contender in the mobile payments space as well. As consumers see the financial rewards and Uber continues to build trust and ease-of-use with its payments platform, it could have a chance at being a real force in the fragmented US mobile payments market, and becoming more similar to mobile platforms like Go-Jek and WeChat abroad.The best chance of this working however is if Uber becomes an aggregator and platform for delivery and service based businesses; it has a strong impetus for becoming the default processor for these businesses anyways, and can offer customers discounts and incentives in a way that Google or Apple canâ€™t â€” in-app at the point of payment. By being the platform where the transactions take place, Uber positions itself in a way that other providers who only seek to be the payments conduit can only aspire to.Uberâ€™s massive transportation network is a huge asset to its operations and logistics clout. Uberâ€™s main ambition is revolutionizing transportation, but Uber can become a platform that facilitates a plethora of other businesses. Leveraging its logistics and demand aggregation strengths to become a services and delivery empire, and using that to bootstrap a robust payments services platform is a promising path forward for Uber.You can find more of my work at https://obaidfarooqui.com/.----1Sometimes my thoughts make it to the internet.

Since the recent past, chatbots have gained much momentum in providing better options to the varied client base.Counting upon its benefits like an instant response, efficient updates in a real-time and interactive form of communication.Chatbots provides a complete pack of everything.Gearing up for a top-notch digital time, a chatbot is the need of the hour which will encourage better business flow.To name some live examples, chatbots have seen much preference. This may include brand names like Sephora, KLM, Marriott, Pizza Hut and others.Think about your customers. It can happen like- While surfing through social media (i.e. Facebook) someone likes to buy a black cocktail dress. If she wants to buy or check out then and there, a pop-up of chat should crop-in and should provide full details of the searched product.Know about your target audience deeply. Understand the type of conversation they like to have. You can recognize this better through conversational chatbots. This is offered by Uberbot, botsify and much more. It also includes incorporating chat-icon on the most visually perfect space over the site. Here, the main motto should be accessibility, provide efficiently.Your client database should be kept open for your botâ€™s learning. You just cannot set bars and segmentize your bot learning. But, it is important to set goals according to your business for botâ€™s training.For instance, if you are preparing a chatbot for your tech-business, you need to check out a bot for Slack. This has been the best option for many formal spaces who are managing and completing tasks on time without any hurdle.Remember, the tonality of your chatbot should be informal but do not use jargon. It should have a sense of familiarity and comfort while pitching your customers. The overall experience should be positively related to the conversation type. Adding to this more, answers received and purchases made.It should provide a seamless experience. That clients who are communicating cannot able to judge whether the other side of the channel has a human figure or not.It is your responsibility that when you are creating your chatbot, it should be well-approachable and easy.While programming your chatbot, you should take the help of artificial intelligence. This will help it to respond more logically.It is well understood that if a chatbot is communicating, the tone would be formal, repetitive and answer in a more set way. But, when incorporating AI, it would get the core of knowledge of the database and would not look like you are talking to some robot.Through this, you can automate your customer support for better responses. This will never miss any deadline as everything is handled by a chatbot. This will reduce the maintenance cost of support by 30 percent.This is all basic but important. Do not forget to segmentize the theme according to the color of the site. It is the part of your site, it should look similar. The icon and the name of the bot should be replicating the site color and the message of your site.Chatbots have become the need of every business. One should incorporate it so to have maximum conversation and queries by the customers. It provides a platform which will keep every information in the thread. And thereby, reciprocate accordingly.Business is a responsibility where chatbots can play an efficient role. Chatbot revolution is upon us and we should be taking it seriously than keeping a large number of revenue on the table.Keeping pace with the digital scenario. Automation and marketing techniques go hand-in-hand for better branding. Here, a chatbot too plays a key role in promoting your site under the lens for better customer experience.So, if your customer experience stands at a stake. A chatbot is an ultimate solution to grab everything and smoothly automate from start till the end.----Entrepreneur. Co-Founder at MakeWebBetter | WP Swings | CedCommerce | CedCoss.

50,51623,https://medium.com/@SageRecruiting/why-youre-losing-top-talent-c88bee2fc0c8?source=tag_archive---------115-----------------------,Why Youâ€™re Losing Top Talent,None,Ashley Alfred,https://medium.com/@SageRecruiting,4,69,0,"Ashley AlfredFollow--ListenShareAttracting and retaining talent is becoming more and more difficult as organizations grow and as tech continues to boom. We have spoken to hundreds of hiring managers and to thousands of candidates over the last six years and have determined some of the top reasons people leave their jobs. The costs associated with backfill are extensive. For a medium-sized company, the annual cost of turnover is $1.57 million. Depending on the size of your company, these can be magnanimous. The following will help you determine where to focus your efforts to mitigate these challenges and increase employee retention throughout your organization.STAGNATIONA common concern that candidates express to us is a lack of challenge in their role. According to a study conducted by Harris Poll, almost 77% of employees feel theyâ€™re â€˜on their ownâ€˜ to develop their careers within a company. A lack of career growth and advancement is one of the biggest reasons people leave their jobs. The 2019 Millennial Manager Workplace Survey reports that 75% of millennials believe that constantly changing jobs advanced their careers. You canâ€™t promote everyone, but you can ensure that people are doing interesting work and constantly learning. Building and learning new technologies is one of the best ways you can keep your team learning. Make sure to spread the maintenance around and ensure that everyone gets to do interesting work from time-to-time.WORK-LIFE BALANCETech is not a predictable 9â€“5 role and anyone in this industry knows that sometimes there are long hours involved. However, sleeping at the office should never be the norm. Work-life balance is considered one of the top deciding factors by 73% of job seekers when assessing a new role; as such, a lot of companies are now offering flexible hours and the option to work from home. There are times during a critical launch when additional hours will be required, but if your team is constantly working late in the evening and on weekends, they will burn out. Too much stress on the job can create a toxic culture. Stay apprised of your team; when you see them working late steadily, remind them to log off. Employ walking meetings, offer mental health days, ensure they take a vacation and explore other ways to create balance.COMPENSATIONMoney isnâ€™t everything, but it is one of the reasons that 25% of people leave their jobs, though less prevalent among Millennials. A lot of candidates begin looking elsewhere if they feel that they arenâ€™t getting paid their worth. A common area this occurs is in startups. As a role evolves and responsibilities grow, itâ€™s only fair that the compensation should follow suit. Another common mistake is underpaying newcomers. 1.2 million new immigrants came to Canada between 2011â€“2016, yet they make 16% less than those born in Canada. Theyâ€™re also typically younger and have more education than the average Canadian. The cost of hiring and training someone is high and since 59% of developers are open to new job opportunities, youâ€™re not saving anything by underpaying if they leave.FALSE HOPESThis is when someone leaves the organization within their first few months. According to a survey done by Jobvite, 30% of job seekers have left a job within 90 days of starting. There are many reasons people leave a job in the first few months, but the main reasons we have seen are disorganized leadership, incomplete interview process, the position being different from what they signed up for, inadequate training or an incomplete or poor onboarding experience. Disorganized employees who earn $50,000 annually fosters companies an additional $11,000 in lost time. Transfer this to a new hire, and that amount will most definitely increase. You never get a second chance to make a first impression â€” this adage applies to leadership if they want to retain the talent theyâ€™ve acquired.CULTUREA negative culture will always chase away the best engineers because theyâ€™re marketable and can find another job in a matter of weeks â€¦or as quick as 12.5 days for some developer roles. A lack of recognition for their efforts and accomplishments are obvious reasons why people leave their jobs, as are stressful or toxic environments. Happy hour and team events after hours are not for everyone. Instead, focus your team events during working hours to build team cohesion and alleviate the stress of working long hours. According to Forbes, 36% of employees say lack of recognition is the top reason to leave their jobs. Take the time to give your team a shout out when theyâ€™ve reached critical milestones, or have been putting in extra hours. Small gestures truly go a long way!Attracting the right talent is challenging; retaining that talent is critical to the success of your team and your company.----I am a start-up enthusiast, entrepreneur, and business development specialist.

Itâ€™s very basic to understand why. When you have more energy, you are more productive at work and have better physical and mental performance. Moreover having more energy means that your body is healthy and your immune system is at its best to defend itself. Therefore having more energy results in having a much better daily life.What does energy tracking mean?Tracking your energy is actually converting your energy level of the day into a representative score. But simply getting a global score of your energy level wouldnâ€™t be completely useful. Whatâ€™s more useful is to be able to split your energy score into several components with individual scores and improve them individually over time to improve your overall energy.And the good news is that 50% of your energy level depends on your daily habits, activity, nutrition, and sleep. An additional 20% depends on your environment. So basically, you can control and influence your energy level at 70%. Genetics and treatment affect the other 30%.After I wake up, I get a general score indicating my energy level for the day. It allows me to know if I can surpass myself or if I need to keep it cool. And if I see or feel that Iâ€™m not in great shape, I know what parameters are in deficit and thus what I have to adjust for the incoming days.Yes, there may be a difference between your score and how you feel. And thatâ€™s when it gets interesting. In the fast-paced society in which we live, Westerners have lost the ability to take the time to feel their body and detect problems before symptoms of illness arrive. While more and more people understand that prevention is better than cure, we know that taking care of yourself in time is logically better than expensive treatment, and a life with drugs.Circular can give back this ability to you. You can know when you start to be weak before the symptoms of illness begin since it can allow you to detect trends of certain metrics over several days that are able to tell your immune status.But how do I track my energy level?I use the Circular smart ring that includes sensors monitoring body signals. It is connected to an app that analyzes your sleep and activity in order to improve them and your general wellness. But not only that, it allows you to wake up at the optimum moment and receive your important alerts with vibrations.The ring is connected to an app that gives you all the insights you need to better understand your body and empower your daily life.This is what my energy score looks like. As with all Circular scores, a score equal or above 90 is Excellent, from 80 to 89 is Good and below 80 is Poor.The energy levels score is a score that is composed of parameters from previous days:All of these parameters have different coefficients depending on their importance.Heart rate variability (HRV)HRV measures the specific changes in time (or variability) between successive heartbeats. It is used to see how well you recover after certain events, it is also a good measurement of stress and anxiety and can unveil many things about your overall well being. The higher it is the better: your body and immune system are then ready to tackle challenges during an upcoming day whereas the contrary would probably mean you need to rest.Typically, if you have slept well, did not exercise, had a balanced diet (no smoking or alcohol) but you see your HRV and your RHR (next metric) drop over 2 days compared to your baseline, you should start taking care of yourself even if you donâ€™t feel sick.Resting heart rate (RHR)RHR is also a great measure for your overall health, correlated to your HRV. Although, this one focuses more on your fitness levels and is great at detecting minor heart conditions. A higher (compared to your baseline) RHR indicates poor overall wellness conditions. Coupling it to HRV and recovery gives us insights as to other factors that might affect your readiness such as irregular heart rate conditions, dehydration, an increase in temperature or even an increase in emotions.Activity VolumeActivity volume is used to quantify whether you do enough physical activity according to the World Health Organization literature but also in comparison to your own amount of activity with your own baseline.RecoveryRecovery is a very important aspect to take into consideration when checking your overall condition (of course). Circular automatically checks your activity volume in the past 35 hours. It should not exceed 20 minutes of high-intensity activity (or its equivalent 40 min of medium intensity activity). As extreme as it sounds, nobody can withstand that much exercising without recovery, even athletes. Even though you are able to, the scientific literature is clear on the subject, it is unhealthy to exceed such amounts without recovery. If you do, it will negatively impact the recommendation you might see on your feed.Sleep quality score & Sleep balanceSleep quality evaluates your past 2 nightâ€™s and checks their quality: it takes a number of contributors into considerations including your sleep length, time in each phase and much more.Sleep balance is based on a longer-term view of your sleep patterns. It compares the past two weeks of your sleep duration to your long-term sleep history and takes into account the amount of recommended sleep time necessary for you.Wake up scoreEach time you wake up wearing the Circular ring either with or without the smart or non-smart alarm clock, you can find your Wake up score in the â€œAlarm clockâ€ circle that evaluates in which sleep stage you woke up in. The perfect moment for you to feel refreshed is to wake you up during the light 1 sleep stage. At this perfect moment, you will receive a 100 score. The score is then adjusted depending on how far away from that perfect moment you woke up.To concludeIf you get an excellent score, be assured that it means what it means. Every aspect of your body whether it is the immune system, stress levels or activity recuperation are excellent. It means that you can do intense activities, intense mental activities, having minimal risks of getting sick. You can push yourself throughout the day. If thatâ€™s what you usually go about, youâ€™ll be able to do just that, better. Use good days like these to your advantage as they arenâ€™t all that frequent (unfortunately).If you get a poor score, you guessed it, donâ€™t push yourself. Focus on recovering, donâ€™t overtrain and donâ€™t hesitate to go to bed a little bit earlier.----Co-founder @Circularing | Award-winning wearable tech | The Smart Ring that Unleashes Your Full Potential | www.circular.xyzUnbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Robert Roy Britt--12Scott H.

I spent the past three days reading different articles and watching videos about BLoC. And I canâ€™t emphasize enough how important having a sound architecture is for a app. So today weâ€™ll focus on understanding the core concepts of BLoC pattern.During the starting days of my career as a Android Developer back in 2015, like every novice programmer I couldnâ€™t understand what was the need of an architecture after-all. I sure as hell loved programming, the first few apps I built, worked pretty well and so being the novice programmer I was, I didnâ€™t feel the need to learn anything about architectures.Time is the best teacher.Yes, and I learnt it the hard way. By the start of 2016 I had lot of work on my hand and continuously maintaining and adding features to the apps I was working on, became a nightmare for me. It was around this time that I realized how a sound architecture and testing could save me a lot of time. It was around this time when my brain shifted to thinking more like a Developer and less like a Programmer.So What is a BLoC? A BLoC is an interface between the data sources in your app (Firebase, Database, Rest API) and the UI. Itâ€™s used for State Management in Flutter. It takes the userâ€™s inputs as Events, handles the business logic, calls the repository if necessary and returns a State back to the UI.Letâ€™s go through all the key parts of the above diagram.Using BLoC pattern has quite some benefits, like :Under the hood BLoC uses Dartâ€™s StreamBuilder APIs and RxDart. If you arenâ€™t familiar with streams and reactive programming Iâ€™ll highly recommend you checkout this intro.Weâ€™ll need to implement three things for it:Letâ€™s say we have a screen with a login form. The possible bare minimum states, events and flow can be:From the diagram we can see that the LoginEvent and the starting UninitializedState are passed to the BLoC on button press. The username and password are passed as parameters with the LoginEvent. The BLoC calls the repository, and based on the response received from it (Auth Success/Auth Fail) shows the Home Page or the Login Failed Page.There can be more possible states and events like Forgot password, new registration, etc. as well.I started the series by building up the UI first, now weâ€™re done with major sections of the UI. Weâ€™ll start building the rest of the app. In the next post weâ€™ll add Firebase to our app and implement itâ€™s Provider. Later on weâ€™ll build our first set of states, events and BLoC classes for the Register Page. Stay tuned !Also, here are all the videos/blogs I went through for understanding BLoCs :Thatâ€™s all for today. Cheers !PS: Do not confuse BLoC pattern with flutter_bloc . BLoC is a pattern whereas flutter_bloc is just a package which helps in implementing the pattern.Press the clap button below if you liked reading this post.

What is not so well-known is how much AI has also established itself as a crucial tool in academics, particularly for scientific discovery.An interdisciplinary team of chemists, physicists, and computer scientists from the University of Warwick, the Technical University of Berlin, and the University of Luxembourg have developed a deep learning algorithm that leverages fundamental quantum mechanics equations to accurately predict the quantum mechanical wave functions of molecules. This provides a probability distribution for the value of each observable of the quantum system, from which additional ground-truth properties of the molecules can be derived.The research team say the study â€œopens promising avenues to perform inverse design of molecular structures for targeting electronic property optimization and a clear path towards increased synergy of machine learning and quantum chemistry,â€The team was assembled through a UCLA fellowship program on machine learning in quantum physics and has been working together for three years.Paper co-author Reinhard Maurer from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick says the novel research undertaking â€œrequired computer science know-how to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm flexible enough to capture the shape and behaviour of wave functions, but also chemistry and physics know-how to process and represent quantum chemical data in a form that is manageable for the algorithm.â€To predict the quantum mechanical wave functions, the algorithm first learnt to solve fundamental equations of quantum mechanics.Solving these equations in the conventional way requires massive high-performance computing resources, and can often take months of very pricey computing time. For this reason, compute is typically the bottleneck in the design of new purpose-built molecules for medical and industrial applications. The newly developed algorithm however is able to supply accurate predictions within seconds on just a laptop or smartphone. This output can be applied to drastically speed up future simulation efforts for the design of drug molecules or new materials.The study is â€œan important progress as it shows that AI methods can efficiently perform the most difficult aspects of quantum molecular simulations,â€ says paper co-author Klaus Robert-Muller from the Institute of Software Engineering and Theoretical Computer Science at the Technical University of Berlin. â€œWithin the next few years, AI methods will establish themselves as essential part of the discovery process in computational chemistry and molecular physics.â€The paper Unifying machine learning and quantum chemistry with a deep neural network for molecular wavefunctions was released in June on arXiv and published in the November Nature Communications.Journalist: Yuan Yuan | Editor: Michael SarazenWe know you donâ€™t want to miss any stories.

She works in international and IT law and analyzes the impact of digital technologies on the modern state, its politics, and society. She has worked extensively with the University of Heidelberg, first setting up a tech startup on behalf of the rector, and later heading the Rectorâ€™s office. As founding managing director, she built up the political interest group of the strongest research universities in Germany in Berlin. Before this, she worked in technology and environmental law for 10 years at a Berlin law firm. We met Denise to talk about her current book project and the challenges in European digitalization.I am working on what is probably the most interesting challenge for humans in a long time. I advise companies and ministries on strategic and regulatory issues related to digital technologies. I am also concerned with what it means to be human in the hybrid age, i.e. in the time in which man and machine are more and more connected. This question sounds very diffuse at first, but it actually encompasses all the fundamentally important sectors that make us human in society. In modern Europe, the innovation and defense capacity of enlightened liberal societies is at the forefront.The compendium is based on the idea that few of us have a figurative idea of cyberspace as a realm of activity for human beings. We all operate on social media channels or in the economic environment of e-commerce corporations, or as entrepreneurs on the Internet ourselves. But hardly anyone can imagine what this â€œspaceâ€ looks like or how best to behave in it. Since our physically tangible world mixes with the virtual one, it is imperative that we develop an idea of this new frontier. A good illustration of this is a comparison with an apartment, where we know how we behave in the living room, kitchen, or bathroom; we learned during childhood that a hot stove is dangerous. In cyberspace, it is not always quite clear where we can do what and where dangers lurk: the Darknet or social media channels often open young people up to cyberbullying, for example. Every successful hacker attack reveals carelessness that we often cannot afford, because every data theft can provoke dizzying damage. Accordingly, cybercrime has long since overtaken international drug trafficking in terms of revenue levels. If we now all knew how we could or must behave, the world would be a bit easier. The book, on which, moreover, experts from politics, business and science from all over the world have worked together, is intended to describe this virtual space. It is intended to help us take a clearer look at the real digital world. Hopefully, after reading it the user will have a better idea of what is and what is not, or perhaps what can be done.We need an inventory because we think about virtual space within the framework of old thought patterns. But itâ€™s about intangible data and information that governments and companies alike are â€œfightingâ€ over. In order to be able to capture this cyberspace with our imagination at all, we must be able to engage with its different physical form. For example, it is said that the digital world is flattening our analog world. It dismantled hierarchies to the same extent that it flattened boundaries and their original meaning. There are suddenly connections between institutions or people who would never have met before. A good example is the legal systems. In the organizational theory of law state power, i.e. politics, the nation state stands next to citizens and the national territory. Together, these three factors make up our modern nation-state and act as the foundation of a political authorityâ€™s ability to set the law and enforce it.Today it is different. For example, evidence-gathering proceedings are also conducted in third countries: attributing incidents in cyberspace is not only a great challenge, it also usually crosses the territories of other nations. Today, international corporations are dealt with simultaneously according to the territories in whose jurisdictions they operate. This can lead to the sudden inclusion of corporate entities in proceedings that would never have been considered before. In these areas, particular attention must now be paid to all electronic communications from corporate members.A major challenge is the flattening of hierarchies and the associated vertical cooperation model between employees and executives, but also between one company and another. It comes from the culture of Silicon Valley and ultimately from the scientific landscape. To this day, it has imposed its culture on the structure of the Internetâ€“ the basic decision-making protocols were developed at the University of California according to scientific criteria and are still valid today. A further challengeâ€“ dynamic and even organically growingâ€“ will be the change in professional profiles. In my profession, for example, it is said that Legal Tech is a substitute for many lawyers. However, new jobs are also being created, for example in the forensic law and science sector, which, incidentally, is no longer as new as many German lawyers might think.Digital technologies can increase efficiency and help us to balance peopleâ€™s own biases. However, at the end of every decision, there will probably still be a human being for a long time to come. Experts disagree as to when, if at all, we will experience a technology that reaches, if not exceeds, human intelligence. The technologies can enable new products and business models that in turn make life easier for us. A stronger individualization of products helps to increase customer satisfaction. The consolidation of data available in companies today, but not yet analyzable, will contribute significantly to the improvement of logistics chains, business processes and products. There are voices saying that artificial intelligence will help us become better people. For example, digital technology can improve a companyâ€™s environmental performance and thus contribute to clean cities. This in turn increases the credibility of the companyâ€™s brand and enhances its reputation.Digital technologies will relieve us of previously unpleasant and monotonous work, perhaps even operating without our supervision, which has many ramifications. For example, there will be a transition phase in which there will be bad new jobs and badly paid old jobs.Max Tegmark, a physics professor at MIT in Cambridge, says that we humans are entering the third phase of being human on earth. In the beginning, we were in the biological phase on the planet. Then followed the cultivated phase of humanity. With machines, we are now entering the technical phase of human existence.The influence that machines have on us will also change what we describe as being human. In Estonia, for example, there are already observable changes, since many people no longer personally deal with their official visits or election decisions in an onsite institution. They can be carried out at any time from home thanks to sophisticated technologies. This has changed their social manners, as they no longer had to maintain personal contacts with public officials. We can also observe this in Berlin S-Bahn trains or on an ICE train ride. In my opinion, Germans are generally not very talkative with people unknown, but even the few conversations we have had so far, are now substituted by digital communication through the â€œremote control of our livesâ€, i.e. mobile phones. These changes will probably deepen the more we underpin our communication channels with machines and algorithms. Portable AI would also help to ensure that communication that used to require coordination with other humans will soon be mechanised. That means two things: The accustomed human interaction is engineered. From this it follows that we as creative and free people will simply discover and develop new communication, which will bring us as humanity a step forward again and represent our distinguishing characteristic as biological animals rather than machines. This is a future scenario, which moves completely in the sense of Enlightenment ideology, when people manage techology in the human sense.I always advise people to be risk-conscious and open to risks. We all experience that the usual thinking patterns, legal frameworks and funding concepts reach their limits. As a result, we have to rethink them. Naturally, this cannot happen overnight: the legislator must first understand what is happening, and then this development must be so significant that setting up a new system is justified. One example of this is the EU Data Protection Regulation. It is based on old paradigms and old ideas of data, ownership and responsibility for protection. To this end, it has a two-year experimental phase, after which it will be evaluated. During this period, we all develop the new level playing field together with the responsible data protection authorities. My guess is that we will see more and more â€œexperimental clausesâ€ such as those that have long been used in university law, for example. With this courage to experiment, you also have to go for innovations in the world of business. This includes not only agile work and team structure, but also our way of thinking and leadership. We must say goodbye to the physical frameworks with which we have all grown up and create an idea of a dynamic virtual communication space consisting of data.----Hello.

GonzÃ¡lez, co-founder of Change the Terms and Vice President of Strategy for Free Press said:â€œItâ€™s encouraging to see Twitter break ranks in Silicon Valley and attempt to stop exploitative political actors from endangering lives, spreading misinformation, and suppressing democracy. Twitterâ€™s decision is not a comprehensive or long-term solution to address online hate, but the move is a step ahead of Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg should end his platformâ€™s misguided free pass for politicians at the expense of public safety.â€œItâ€™s important to remember that politicians and bad actors spread hate beyond paid ads, including the white supremacist accounts that Twitter still hosts, like David Duke, Richard Spencer and 8chan. The decision to ban all political advertising helps prevent politiciansâ€™ paid-for hate and misinformation from spreading on Twitter, but ignores the racial animus at the core of the problem â€” one that must be addressed with civil rights in mind to have a lasting impact. Paid ads are just a small piece of an insidious issue: Hate speech, racism, white supremacy, and content that incites violence remain widespread online, and especially on Twitter. Banning political ads alone is not nearly enough to make Twitter a place for healthy conversations.â€œTechnology companies have the power and capacity to make major changes to curb online hate, and they should use it. They must take responsibility for reducing hate on their platforms, and that responsibility doesnâ€™t stop and start with advertising â€” it includes all posts, particularly those from politicians which are boosted by social media algorithms and recommended to millions.â€###Change the Terms is a coalition calling on technology companies to institute and enforce service agreement prohibitions on hateful activities to protect public safety and respect diverse voices. The coalition includes more than 50 civil rights, human rights, technology policy and consumer protection organizations dedicated to encouraging internet companies, social media sites, payment processors and chat services to commit to fair, effective and transparent rules and practices for content moderation.----We believe that tech companies need to do more to combat hateful conduct on their platforms.Change the Terms Coalition--Change the Terms Coalition--Change the Terms Coalition--Change the Terms Coalition--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Four years into realizing our vision, Clutter is now the worldâ€™s largest on-demand storage provider.Now, millions of people can conveniently and affordably store their belongings with Clutter in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and the Bay Area, Seattle, Chicago, Philadelphia, New Jersey, San Diego and Orange County.To do this, we undertook the difficult but crucial task of building a vertically integrated supply chain that, to date, includes 500 W-2 team members, nearly 2 million square feet of warehouse space, a fleet of over 200 trucks and a proprietary technology stack that intelligently manages these resources.Today, weâ€™re excited to announce weâ€™ve closed a $200 million Series D round of financing led by the SoftBank Vision Fund with participation from Sequoia Capital, Atomico, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Fifth Wall Ventures and Four Rivers. This funding will accelerate our expansion into new markets in 2019, including Philadelphia, Portland and Sacramento. Weâ€™re also doubling down on our existing markets as we march toward our goal of operating in Americaâ€™s largest 50 cities and expanding internationally.When we embarked on our Series D fundraising process this January, we knew we wanted a capital partner with a long-term focus and an ambitious mandate. With $100 billion in capital to invest and a long-term time horizon, SoftBankâ€™s Vision Fund is undoubtedly financing infrastructure for the society of tomorrow and we couldnâ€™t be more excited to become a long-term partner with them.Fifty-five percent of the worldâ€™s population lives in cities; in the next few decades, that number is predicted to climb to 70 percent. Available real estate within cities will become increasingly more scarce and therefore, more expensive.In the U.S., self-storage facilities consume more real estate than all of our nationâ€™s Starbucks and McDonaldâ€™s combined. A self-storage facility, on average, employs just two people and generates little taxable income for the city in which it is located.Clutterâ€™s logistics network and supply chain leverages real estate in industrial zones far outside the city center. As a result, we give cities back precious real estate that can be repurposed for affordable housing, parks or other more value accretive causes. We also employ and provide benefits to a large pool of hourly laborers who help deliver the service.Since the beginning, we envisioned Clutter as a part of the fabric of society. Today, weâ€™re excited to say that the infrastructure weâ€™re building with the help of partners like the SoftBank Vision Fund will facilitate the continued urbanization of the world.----ClutterCo-founder of ClutterAri MirinClutter--Ari MirinClutter--Ari MirinClutter--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Scott H.

65,12508,https://medium.com/@julianusnadeak/pemanfaatan-tempat-tinggal-sebagai-ladang-bisnis-mamikos-a1c62e9ecf7f?source=tag_archive---------52-----------------------,Pemanfaatan Tempat Tinggal sebagai Ladang Bisnis-MamiKos,None,Julianus Nadeak,https://medium.com/@julianusnadeak,13,226,0,"Julianus NadeakFollow--9SharePemanfaatan Tempat Tinggal sebagai Ladang Bisnis-MamiKosI. Latar BelakangTempat tinggal merupakan suatu kebutuhan pokok yang harus di penuhi oleh setiap manusia. Mencari info kost adalah sesuatu yang wajib dilakukan oleh anak rantau. Melanjutkan pendidikan di luar kota atau bekerja di luar kota tentunya sudah bukan hal yang aneh lagi saat ini. Mereka yang memutuskan untuk merantau haruslah hidup di luar kota asalnya dan tinggal di hunian sementara seperti di kamar kost. Mencari kamar kost yang sesuai dengan keinginan dan budget bukanlah hal yang sepele. Memilih ukuran dan tempat tinggal merupakan suatu kebutuhan yang perlu disesuaikan dengan keperluan.Pada sekarang ini pada daerah yang banyak didatangi oleh para perantau sudah banyak menyediakan sewa tempat tingal bukan hanya puluhan melainkan ratusan lokasi dengan harga, lokasi, dan fasilitas yang disediakan. Bagi perantau yang melakukan perjalanan pertama kali pada daerah tretentu biasanya akan melakukan survey dari satu tempat ketempat lain yang dapat membutuhkan waktu yang cukup lama, dan apabila perantau ingin segera mendapatkan tempat tinggal maka hal ini sangat tidak efektif dilaksanakan. Cara yang biasa dilakukan adalah dengan mengandalkan kenalan atau keluarga yang berada pada daerah yang dituju. Namun pada era digital ini pencarian dapat dilakukan dengan lebih mudah dan cepat dengan bantuan internet. Dengan bantuan internet penyediaan informasi akan semakin mudah dan cepat sehingga si pencari akan semakin mudah menentukan pilihan.Salah satu aplikasi yang menggunakan internet untuk menghubungkan orang-orang yang hendak melakukan transaksi adalah Mamikos. Mamikos merupakan aplikasi yang menyediakan informasi mengenai kamar kost, fasilitas yang disediakan, harga, dan dekorasi kamar, foto ataupun video desain kamar yang mendiskripsikan keadaan kamar dan lingkungan disesuaikan dengan kondisi yang sebenarnya. Jangkauan daerah yang dicakup dimulai dari kawasan Jabodetabek, Jogjakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Malang, Semarang, Bali hingga Makassar dan Medan.Secara sederhana, Mamikos bekerja sebagai â€˜jembatanâ€™ untuk menghubungkan para pencari hunian sewa sementara atau kost dengan para penyedianya. Untuk memudahkan para penggunanya mencari kost, Mamikos menyediakan fitur pencarian berdasarkan Area atau Daerah Populer, Kampus atau Universitas, dan berdasarkan lokasi pengguna. Di samping itu masih ada fitur Berlangganan untuk mendapatkan informasi via aplikasi dan email, fitur Favorit untuk menyimpan kost yang ingin ditinjau kembali, dan fitur Histori untuk melihat data-data kost yang pernah dilihat.Fitur yang disediakan bukan hanya menyediakan dalam hal pencarian lokasi saja melainkan juga dapat secara langsung mendapatkan nomor telepon pemiliki sehingga dapat memudahkan mendapatkan informasi secara terperinci. Dengan bantuan aplikasi ini juga menyediakan informasi akan pendapat-pendapat penghuni terdahulu akan kost tersebut sehingga pelanggan dapat mempertimbangkan pilihan kost yang akan di tempati.Sementara itu untuk fitur pencarian yang lebih umum, pengguna dapat menyaring kebutuhan kost berdasarkan Tipe Kost, Fasilitas, Jangka Waktu, Provinsi, Area, Kecamatan, Rentang Harga, dan Lainnya. Saat ini terdapat tiga tipe kost yang dapat dicari melalui Mamikos, yaitu Kost Putra, Kost Putri, dan Kost Campur. Pasangan suami istri (Pasutri) dan akses kost 24 jam juga menjadi pertimbangan lain dalam mencari kost melalui Mamikos.Saat ini MAMIKOS memiliki lebih dari 15,000+ Data kost dari seluruh Indonesia terutama Kost di Jakarta, Kost daerah Bogor, Kost di Depok, Kost sekitar Tangerang, Kost Bandung, Kost di Surabaya, Kost Jogja, Kost Jakarta Selatan, Kost jakarta pusat dll. Di mamikos ada juga sewa kost harian & tempat kost eksklusif. Data kost yang ada di Mamikos diperoleh terutama dari pengambilan data langsung oleh MAMIKOS di kost tersebut karena untuk memastikan mendapatkan data lokasi dan fasilitas akurat serta foto lengkap.Hal yang membedakan Mamikos dengan aplikasi pencari kost lainnya adalah dalam soal akurasi data. Data-data kost yang ada di Mamikos tak perlu Anda ragukan kebenarannya karena Mamikos menggunakan agen surveyor yang turun langsung ke lapangan dan bertemu dengan pemilik kost. Mereka ini jugalah yang mengambil foto-foto seputar kamar kost yang nantinya ditampilkan dalam aplikasi. Jadi, jangan takut mendapatkan info kost yang hoax karena di Mamikos semua datanya 100% asli dan terverifikasi. Selain soal data, Mamikos juga memiliki keunggulan dalam soal sistem pencarian kost. Fitur pencarian kost yang ada di aplikasi ini lebih mudah dan terintegrasi. Alhasil, Anda bisa mencari kost jenis apapun dan di manapun lokasinya. Anda bisa mencari kos-kosan berdasarkan kota, wilayah, atau bahkan dengan patokan dekat kampus atau sekolah. Mamikos juga menggunakan sistem GPS sehingga bisa mendeteksi lokasi-lokasi kost di dekat Anda saat itu juga. Hal lain yang membedakan Mamikos dengan aplikasi pencarian kost yang lainnya adalah kemudahan untuk menggunakan aplikasinya karena Mamikos tak hanya tersedia untuk user Android saja namun juga bisa diunduh di AppStore untuk pengguna iOS. Mamikos juga tersedia dalam bentuk website sehingga bisa diakses menggunakan komputer atau laptop.II. KesimpulanKost merupakan solusi sebagai tempat tinggal sementara yang hendak pergi dan tinggal di suatu tempat dalam jangka waktu yang sementara. Bagi perantau yang hendak melakukan perantauan pertama kali, hal pertama yang akan dilakukan adalah melakukan survei dengan daerah yang ingin dituju. Untuk mencari kost di daerah yang belum pernah di kunjungi atau di daerah yang masih asing bagi pelanggan menjadikan mencari kost hal yang sangat sulit. Perantau biasanya melakukan survei dengan sendiri ataupun mengandalkan keluarga maupun kenalan yang berada pada daerah yang dituj. Biasanya hal ini akan memakan waktu yang sangat lama karena pelanggan akan menemui satu persatu lokasi kost yang tersedia dan melakukan diskusi baik harga dan alat yang disediakan. Tindakan tersebut kurang efektif untuk dilakukan terutama bagi perantau yang ingin mendapatkan tempat istirahat dengan secepat mungkin. Oleh karena itu dibutuhkan suatu apliksai yang dapat menghubungkan antar pelanggan dan penyedia tempat tinggal untuk dapat saling berkomunikasi atau berhubungan sehingga memudahkan diskusi dan pencarian tempat yang sesuai dengan kebutuhan.Pada era sekarang ini internet merupakan suatu teknnologi yang sangat berguna dalam membantu melaksanakan pekerjaan manusia sebagai contoh untuk memudahkan antar manusia dapat saling berkomunikasi dan saling berbagi informasi. Sebagai contoh aplikasi yang dibuat untuk dapat menghubungkan antar pelanggan dan penyedia tempat tinggal yaitu Mamikos. Apliksi ini merupakan aplikasi penyedia informasi lengkap akan pemesanan kost.Mamikos memberikan informasi secara detail mengenai pemesanan kost, waktu pemesanan, lokasi pemesanan, fasilitas yang diberikan, dan deskripsi kost dan biaya pemesanan kost. Kos yang terdaftar dalam Mamikos dapat dijamin karena dilakukan pendataan secara langsung oleh agen Mamikos sehingga pengguna tidak perlu merasa khawatir mengenai keaslian data yang ditampilkan. Pada aplikasi ini sendiri juga sering melakukan pembaharuhan informasi mengenai akan keadaan kost yang telah disediakan.Pada aplikasi ini menyediakan beberapa fitur yang dapat membantu para pengguna aplikasi dapat dengan mudah mengerti dan menggunkan aplikasi ini, yaitu; berbagai foto dan video yang mendiskripsikan keadaan kost dan penyediaan fasilitas yang diberikan oleh penyedia kosan terhadap pelanggan. Foto terebut meliputi kamar, kamar mandi, rumah kos, serta tampilan bangunan. Dengan adanya foto ini dimana pada mami kost menyediakan foto 360 derajat yang memungkinkan pelanggan dapat menjelajahi kost tersebut.Dalam hal pencarian, Mamikos memberikan 3 opsi daerah pencarian kost berdasarkan lokasimu sekarang, universitas, atau kota pilihan. Untuk saat ini, Mamikos baru melayani daerah Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi, Jogjakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Malang, Semarang, Bali, Makassar dan Medan. Filter merupakan fitur yang dapat membantu mempersempit hasil pencarian kost. Fitur ini memberikan beberapa opsi yang dapat memberikan pilihan opsi budget, tipe kost (putra, putri, atau campur), jangka waktu sewa kost (harian, mingguan, bulanan, tahunan), fasilitas kost, seperti isi kamar, tipe kamar mandi (dalam atau luar), tempat parkir, ruang tamu, dapur, dan lain-lain serta layanan tambahan, seperti akses 24 jam atau kost khusus pasutri.Fitur telepon gratis tanpa pulsa. Dengan fitur ini, Anda bisa dengan mudah menelepon pemilik dari kos-kosan yang Anda ingin survey atau ingin sewa kamarnya. Dengan fitur telpon pemilik kost tanpa pulsa ini, Anda tidak akan rugi pulsa meski harus menelepon banyak pemilik kos-kosan.Saat ini MAMIKOS memiliki lebih dari 15,000 data kost dari seluruh daerah Indonesia terutama kost di Jakarta, kost daerah Bogor, kost di Depok, kost sekitar Tangerang, Kost Bandung, kost di Surabaya, kost Jogja, kost Jakarta Selatan, kost jakarta pusat dll. Di mamikos ada juga sewa kost harian & tempat kost eksklusif. Data kost yang ada di Mamikos diperoleh terutama dari pengambilan data langsung oleh MAMIKOS di kost tersebut karena untuk memastikan mendapatkan data lokasi dan fasilitas akurat serta foto lengkap.Mamikos juga memiliki keunggulan dalam soal sistem pencarian kost. Fitur pencarian kost yang ada di aplikasi ini lebih mudah dan terintegrasi. Pelanggan bisa mencari kost jenis apapun dan di manapun lokasinya. Anda bisa mencari kos-kosan berdasarkan kota, wilayah, atau bahkan dengan patokan dekat kampus atau sekolah. Mamikos juga menggunakan sistem GPS sehingga bisa mendeteksi lokasi-lokasi kost di dekat Anda saat itu juga. Hal lain yang membedakan Mamikos dengan aplikasi pencarian kost yang lainnya adalah kemudahan untuk menggunakan aplikasinya karena Mamikos tak hanya tersedia untuk user Android saja namun juga bisa diunduh di AppStore untuk pengguna iOS. Mamikos juga tersedia dalam bentuk website sehingga bisa diakses menggunakan komputer atau laptop.III. AnalisaBagi pelanggan yang sedang mencari tempat tinggal dalam jangka waktu sementara, aplikasi Mamikos merupakan aplikasi yang sangat berguna untuk menyelesaikan masalah mencari tempat tinggal sementara terutama bagi para perantau yang sedang melaksanakan pendidikan di suatu daerah tertentu. Pada aplikasi ini menyediakan penyewaaan tempat tinggal bukan hanya dalam jangka waktu yang panjang melainkan juga dapat dengan waktu satu hari. Dalam melakukan pencarian lokasi kost, apikasi Mamikos menyediakan fitur yang memudahkan pengguna dengan bantuan Google Map. Pengguna juga bisa langsung mengetahui harga dan fasilitas yang diberikan oleh kost tersebut.Kelebihan yang diperoleh oleh pengguna aplikasi ini terdapat pada fitur-fitur yang disediakan oleh aplikasi ini, yaitu; fitur pencarian lokasi kost yang terhubung langsung ke google map untuk membantu pelannggan menemukan lokasi kost yang ingin dituju. Penyediaan lokasi kost pada mamikost juga sangat luas terutama pada lokasi daerah perkotaan besar di seluruh Indonesia. Dalam memudahkan pencarian aplikasi ini juga menyediakan fitur filter untuk mempersempit pencariaan kost sehingga dapat mempercepat proses pencarian kost yang diinginkan. Setelah pemilihan kost yang sesuai dengan keinginan dilakukan para pelanggan tidak perlu khatir akan kehilangan tempat tersebut jakalau suatu waktu tempat yang diinginkan belum dapat langsung ditempati oleh si pelanggan karena aplikasi ini menyediakan fitur booking. Dalam hal untuk mencari informasi yang lebih lanjut aplikasi ini juga menyediakan fitur menelpon gratis tanpa adanya potongan biaya pada pelanggan. Sehingga pembicaraan atau komunikasi dapat berjalan dengan baik dan tidak perlu takut akan data yang digunakan dan proses booking juga dapat dilaksanakan melalui fitur ini. Aplikasi ini juga melakukan update informasi yang terus menerus akan fasilitas kamar yang disediakan dan informasi akan kost tersebut sehingga pelanggan dapat dengan mudah menggambarkan kondisi dari kost tersebut. Informasi juga dapat terjamin karena yang melakukan pengupdate-an adalah agen dari mamikost sendiri sehingga informasi yang diberikan selalu akurat, Mamikos juga menyediakan foto-foto lengkap fasilitas kost, mulai dari kamar kos, kamar mandi, fasilitas umum kost, dan lain sebagainya sehingga penggunanya tak perlu repot survey ke rumah kost. Foto yang disediakan oleh aplikasi ini menggunakan foto 360 derajat yang dapat menampilkan kondisi kost secara keseluruhan sehingga para pelanggan diajak untuk dapat seperti merasa melihat sendiri keadaan kost. Bukan hanya melalui foto, video dan informasi dari penyedia kost melainkan fitur review disediakan untuk dapat menjadi bahan pertimbangan dari para pelangan yang hendak tinggal pada kost tersebut. Fitur ini bukan hanya berguna bagi pelanggan tetapi juga bagi para penyedia dan pihak mami kost sendiri. Hal ini dapt dijadikan sebagai cerminan dari pelayanan yang telah diberikan bagi para pelanggan. Sehingga untuk kedepannya dapat menjadi perbaikan yang memajukan bisnis tersebut.Kekurangan dari aplikasi ini adalah alamat yang diberikan masih kurang lengkap sehingga pencarian lokasi kost masih sulit dilakukan. Selain dari alat yang kurang lengkap masih terdapat penyediaan foto-foto yang ditampilkan berkualitas jelek sehingga kurang dapat memberikan gambaran atau deskirpsi yang cukup akan kost keadaan kost tersebut. Dalam hal foto pengambilan juga masih kurang karena posisi pengambilan foto juga mempengaruhi dari kulitas dari gambar yang diberikan. Sehingga baiknya yang melakukan hal tersebut adalah orang-orang yang lebih handal dan berpengalaman.Pada bisnis ini penulis melihat peluang keuntungan yang cukup besar dengan jasa yang ditawarkan oleh mamikost sangat menguntungkan dan bermanfaat bagi penyedia tempat tinggal dan pelanggan yang sedang membutuhkan tempat tinggal. Jasa yang mereka tawarkan yaitu penyediaan sewa tempat tinggal untuk memanfaatkan lokasi tempat tinggal yang sedang tidak berpenghuni dan sedang membuka usaha penginapan.Pada saat ini sudah terdapat beberapa competitor yang mencoba menyaingi bisnis yang dilakukan oleh mamikos. Beberapa saingan yang layak di perhitungkan yaitu KosKost yang merupakan aplikasi yang hamper sama dengan mamikos tetapi masih terkhusus yang sedang mencari kost di daerah Universitas Indonesia dan Jabodetabek. Aplikasi ini bisa memberikan informasi soal ketersedian kost di daerah-daerah tersebut lengkap dengan detail harga, alamat, kontak pemilik kost, fasilitas kamar dan kostan. Kamu juga bisa mendapatkan informasi lengkap soal mana saja rumah kost yang jadi favorit para mahasiswa baru atau pencari kost di daerah tersebut. Kamu juga bisa mendapatkan direksi via Maps soal alamat rumah kostan, supaya tak kesasar saat pertama meninjau rumah kostan. Saingan kedua yaitu KostHunt kalau aplikasi KosKost menawarkan informasi rumah kost di Jabodetabek, berbeda dengan aplikasi Kost Hunt ini. Aplikasi dengan tampilan keren dan simpel ini menawarkan informasi lengkap seputar rumah kost di sekitar daerah Jatinangor, Jawa Barat. Kelebihan aplikasi ini juga menawarkan informasi seputar kebutuhan anak kost. Beberapa di antaranya adalah jasa sol sepatu, jasa tukang pijit, jasa tukan galon air mineral, jasa pembersih alias beres-beres kostan dan jasa angkut barang saat ingin mau pindahan kostan. Saingan ketiga yaitu IbuKost, aplikasi IbuKost ini bisa dibilang berbeda dengan aplikasi-aplikasi mobile sebelumnya di atas. Apabila aplikasi mobile, seperti Mamikos, KosKost, KostHunt ditujukan bagi orang-orang yang sedang mencari kos-kosan, maka aplikasi IbuKost ini didesain secara khusus untuk para pemilik atau pengasuh kos-kosan. Begitulah, aplikasi mobile ini didesain demi mempermudah pemilik atau pengasuh kos-kosan untuk melakukan manajemen kos-kosan karena IbuKost bakal membantu para pemilik atau pengasuh kos-kosan untuk mengawasi dan mengelola status booking dari para penghuni kos-kosan. InfoKost selain menawarkan informasi kostan di sekitar Jabodetabek, aplikasi ini juga menawarkan informasi properti yang kamu butuhkan dari daerah lainnya seperti Bali, Semarang, Yogyakarta, Malang, Surabaya, Medan, dan Palembang. Sama seperti aplikasi pemberi informasi kostan lainnya, aplikasi ini juga menawarkan informasi lengkap soal harga, alamat, area dan detail informasi lainnya soal kost-kostan. Asyiknya, kamu juga bisa mengirimkan pesan atau menghubungi pemilik kostan langsung dari aplikasi jika kamu tertarik untuk tinggal di rumah atau kamar kostan tersebut.Menurut penulis, ada banyak kemajuan yang diperoleh para mitra mamikos di antaranya adalah kemudahan bagi siapapun yang ingin mencari tempat tinggal dengan mudah dan banyak pilihan. Kemudahan yang diperoleh adalah dalam mencari tempat tinggal, mencari dana, serta desain kost yang lebih memikat perhatian para pengunjungnya. Untuk membantu pencapaian kemajuan para penyedia kost, mamikost menawarkan bantuan promosi yang dapat mendatangkan para pengunjung.Mamikos merupakan start up yang cukup suskses.

Selain dari penyediaan kepuasan pelangga, mamikost juga memperhatikan fasilitas yang diberikan dengan harga yang harus dikeluarkan oleh pelanggan.Mamikos pada awalnya menyediakan kost pada daerah Jabodetabek, Bandung, Jogjakarta, Semarang, Malang dan Surabaya. Namun seiring berjalannya waktu dan peningkatan kebutuhan akan aplikasi ini mamikos sendiri berencana untuk terus meningkatkan pelayanan dan jangkauan listing tempat tinggal yang disediakan, Mamikos berencana untuk melebarkan jangkauan listing mereka ke wilah Bali dan juga kota Semarang. Langkah tersebut masuk akal, mengingat Bali adalah salah satu tujuan wisata terbaik di Indonesia dan Semarang memiliki beberapa Universitas ternama di kotanya.1. Value PropositionSebuah usaha untuk dapat mempertahankan bisnis dapat berjalan dengan baik dan berlangsung lama maka sebuah usaha haruslah memiliki suatu keunikannya sendiri dibandingkan dengan usaha lain. Salah satu value proposition yang di berikan mamakos yaitu membantu untuk mempromosikan kosan yang membutuhkan para pelanggan dan membatu untuk dapat menambah pengetahuan akan teknologi dan seni, kedua mamikos berusaha memberikan kenyamanan semaksimal mungkin kepada pelanggan mereka, mamikos juga bertujuan untuk meningkatkan pendapatan eknomi para warga.2.

KesimpulanInternet merupakan salah satu teknologi yang sangat dibutuhkan untuk saat ini. Internet sudaha dapat dijadikan menjadi suatu kebutuhan yang penting untuk membantu menyelesaikan tugas manusia. Salah satu fungsi internet pada kehidupan manusia adalah sebagai media komunikasi antar sesama pengguna. Sebuah aplikasi dibuat untuk dapat menjembatani antar penggunguna aplikasi dalam kepentingan yang sejalan yaitu aplikasi mamikos. Aplikasi ini berfungsi sebagai jembatan yang dapat menghubungkan antar pemilik tempat tinggal yang mau menyewakan tempat tinggalnya dengan orang yang membutuhkan tempat tinggal.Aplikasi ini menjadi aplikasi nomor satu yang menyediakan layanan tempat tinggal seperti kost. Untuk saat ini Mamikos sudah bekerjasama dengan masyarakat mau memberikan layanan penyewaan tempat tinggal yang lebih dari 15.000 kost yang tersebar di Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi, Jogjakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Malang, Semarang, Bali, Makassar dan Medan. Dan untuk kedepannya mamikos berencara untuk terus mengembangkan list penyediaan kost bukan hanya pada kota-kota besar tetapi hingga daerah-daerah nusantara. Untuk dapat memiliki aplikasi ini dapat didownload pada google play dan app store.Pada apliksai mamikos menyajikan informasi-informasi akurat akan kost yang akan disediakan sehingga para pelanggan dapat memilih dengan banyak pilihan sesuai dengan kebutuhan. Informasi yang di sajikan merupakan alamat akan penyedia kost, fasilitas yang diberikan, foto dan video yang mendiskripsikan keadaan kost, harga sewa, informasi apakah kost tersebut khusus untuk putri, pria ataupun campuran. Pada aplikasi ini menyediakan fitur-fitur yang dapat membantu para pengguna aplikasi yaitu filter untuk mempermudah pencarian kost yang sesuai dengan kebutuhan, fitur telepon geratis tanpa ada pemungutan biaya sehingga komunikasi antar penyedia dan pengguna dapat berlangsung bebas biaya, fitur revie kost yang dapat digunakan sebagai pembandingan untuk menilai kost yang ingin dihuni, fitur foto 360 derajat yang dapat dijadikan untuk dapat mengetahui secara langsung keadaan linggungan kost.Pada aplikasi ini tidak semua fitur yang diberikan sesuai seperti masih terdapat penampilan foto yang buruk baik dari kualitas maupun posisi pengambilan foto sehingga mengurangi kesan akan kondisi dari kost tersebut. Dan bukan hanya itu masih terdapat alamat yang masih kurang lengkap sehingga para pengguna masih kesulitan untuk dapat menemukan lokasi kost untuk itu diberikan solusi mencari dengan menggunakan map yang langsung terhubung dengan aplikasi mamikos. Hal tersebut menjadi hal yang patut untuk diperbaiki agar bisnis dapat berjalan dengan baik dan berjalan dalam jangka waktu yang lama.Untuk dapat menjalankan bisnis ini maka mamikos perlu untuk menjalin kerja sama yang baik bukan hanya pada sesama pembangun aplikasi melainkan juga terhadap penyedia tempat tinggal.

In Blockchain and the Law:The Rule of Code, Primavera De Filippi and Aaron Wright examine both the profound opportunities the technology presents and the legal and even ethical challenges it poses. In the brief excerpt below, they consider possible paths away from our current crossroads between the rule of code and the rule of law.When Satoshi Nakamoto released Bitcoin to the world, he had a clear idea in mind, which was reflected in the message he included in Bitcoinâ€™s genesis block:The Times 03 / Jan / 2009Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banksNakamoto released the Bitcoin network in the middle of a financial crisis, as a reaction to an unstable international banking system. In doing so, he gave birth to a new currency â€” one controlled not by any government or central bank but only by cryptography and code.As a global and decentralized payment system that operates without centralized control, Bitcoin held out the hope of newfound economic freedom for those dubious of governmental authority. Early Bitcoin adopters subscribed to the notion of vires in numeris (strength in numbers), a motto emphasizing the fact that, when it comes to money, only math can be trusted.But Bitcoin was only the first step in a much grander vision. Shortly after Bitcoinâ€™s release, technologists began to realize that the true potential of Bitcoin â€” the real innovation â€” was its underlying data structure: a blockchain. While Bitcoin offered the ability to replace the role of central banks and eliminate the need for financial institutions, blockchain technology could be applied more generally to reduce the need for middlemen in many sectors of the economy. Whenever a trusted authority is necessary to coordinate social or economic activity, blockchain technology could provide the necessary infrastructure to replace this activity. The roles of banks, financial institutions, stock exchanges, clearinghouses, content providers, online operators, and even governmental systems could all be modeled by a set of protocols and code-based rules deployed on top of a blockchain-based network.Blockchain technology presents some risks, however. The technology supports technological systems and decentralized applications that operate independently of any centralized institution or trusted authority. They implement their own internal systems of rules, which often ignore or attempt to circumvent traditional systems of control. Unlike other technological constructs currently deployed on the Internet, these decentralized systems and applications can be governed almost exclusively by the rules of code.The Internet had already raised a fundamental tension between the rule of law, based on geographical boundaries, and the rule of code, based on topological constructs. The regulation of â€œcyberspaceâ€ lies at the intersection between these two normative systems â€” which can either cooperate or compete with one another, depending on the circumstances at hand.At the outset, legal scholars thought that the rule of code would ultimately prevail on the Internet. With code, people could implement their own systems of rules, enforced by a technological construct that operates outside of any legal jurisdiction. This is what inspired a number of technology activists to believe that cyberspace was an unregulatable space that governments did not have the right or ability to control â€” as opposed to the â€œmeat space,â€ which is mostly governed by the rule of law.Eager to bypass the politics of enclosure and control enacted by governments and corporations, these groups believed that the Internet would foster new normative systems, which would facilitate the free flow of information and promote political and cultural autonomy. The Internet marked the beginning of a new paradigm for regulation â€” one where regulation would be applied through the rule of code, with power dynamics that differed significantly from those of the physical world. Over time, however, governments recognized and embraced the potential for the rule of code to maintain the rule of law on the Internet. Governments have extended their control by requiring that intermediaries change their code to maintain and respect jurisdictional laws.With the advent of Bitcoin and blockchain technology more generally, we are poised to witness a new wave of decentralization and new calls that the world will â€” once again â€” be governed by the rule of code. Echoes of the first Internet wave permeate the discourse around blockchains, with claims that blockchain technology will lead to greater individual freedom and emancipation, as these early technology advocates initially aspired to. Blockchain technology is viewed as a new opportunity by many cypherpunks and decentralization advocates, who see it as a new means for people to liberate themselves from the tyranny of governments and corporations â€” in ways that are quite reminiscent of the Internetâ€™s early days.Blockchain technology facilitates the emergence of new self-contained and autonomous systems of rules that create order without law and implement what can be thought of as private regulatory frameworks, which we refer to as lex cryptographica. These systems enable people to communicate, organize, and exchange value on a peer-to-peer basis, with less of a need for intermediary operators. They provide individuals with the opportunity to create a new normative layer or a customized system of code-based rules that can be readily incorporated into the fabric of this new technological construct â€” thereby making it easier for people to circumvent the law.Lex cryptographica shares certain similarities with the more traditional means of regulation by code. Both purport to regulate individuals by introducing a specific set of affordances and constraints embedded directly into the fabric of a technological system. Lex cryptographica, however, distinguishes itself from todayâ€™s code-based regimes in that it operates autonomously â€” independently of any government or other centralized authority.If the vision of blockchain proponents edges toward reality, we may delegate power to technological constructs that could displace current bureaucratic systems, governed by hierarchy and laws, with algocratic systems, governed by deterministic rules dictated by silicon chips, computers, and those that program them. These systems could improve society in demonstrable ways, but they also could restrain rather than enhance individual freedom.When it comes to freedom and autonomy, the assumption that the rule of code is superior to the rule of law is a delicate one â€” and one that has yet to be tested. As Lawrence Lessig has already warned, â€œWhen government disappears, itâ€™s not as if paradise will take its place. When governments are gone, other interests will take their place.â€Those working to liberate individuals from the whims of governments and corporations could wind up surrendering themselves (and others) to the whims of a much more powerful entity: autonomous code. If blockchain technology matures, we will need to acquire a greater understanding of the impact that lex cryptographica could have on society, observing and analyzing the deployment of blockchain-based systems and carefully evaluating how to regulate the technology. As one might expect, the deployment of autonomous systems regulated only by code is likely to raise new challenges when it comes to establishing liability and responsibility, creating tensions between existing legal rules, focused on regulating intermediaries, and these newly established code-based rules.In the end, however, blockchain technology does not spell the end of the rule of law as we know it. Even in a world with widespread use of blockchains, governments still retain their four regulatory levers â€” laws, code, market forces, and social norms â€” which could be used to either directly or indirectly regulate this new technology.Blockchain-based systems can be controlled in areas where they intersect with regulated entities â€” such as individuals, network operators, and all those intermediaries who either develop or support the technology. New intermediaries servicing blockchain-based networks are already beginning to emerge, including hardware manufacturers, miners, virtual currency exchanges, and other commercial operators interacting with a blockchain-based system. So long as these intermediaries remain subject to the rule of law-because of their country of operation or incorporation â€” governments will be able to enforce their laws, either directly or indirectly impacting the way in which lex cryptographica will be defined and enforced.Governments could, for instance, exert pressure on the intermediaries in charge of developing, deploying, or maintaining the technology. They could require software developers and hardware manufacturers of mining devices to implement specific features into their technology to ensure that governments can intervene, if necessary, to regulate autonomous blockchain-based systems. In the case of harm, they could demand that miners censor certain transactions or even revert the blockchain back to its previous state to recover damages or remedy harm. Governments could also impose laws on commercial operators interacting with decentralized blockchain-based applications to regulate the use of these technologies indirectly.Alternatively, or in addition to this, governments could intervene to regulate a blockchainâ€™s underlying incentivization schemes and influence social norms. They could introduce a set of economic incentives aimed at shaping the activities of autonomous blockchain-based systems. Governments also could try to influence social norms, shaping the moral or ethical standards of the community of users and miners supporting a particular blockchain-based network. Indeed, because a blockchain operates through distributed consensus, all parties supporting the network have the power to intervene â€” through a coordinated action â€” to enforce the application of specific legal or community norms.When combined, these different approaches could constrain the operations of lex cryptographica. However, it is far from apparent what combination will enable governments to regulate these emergent blockchain-based systems without excessively limiting the opportunities for innovation.Given that blockchain technology is still largely immature, there is a danger that regulating the technology too early could preclude the emergence of new and unexpected applications that have not yet been fully explored or discovered. Permission-based regulations could prevent public and private parties from freely experimenting with this new technology, ultimately chilling innovation.At the same time, a complete lack of regulation could also prove problematic. Given the lack of a well-defined regulatory framework for blockchain-based applications, parties seeking to deploy the technology could find themselves in a legal gray area, incapable of knowing whether what they are doing today is lawful and whether it will continue to be so further down the line. The lack of a proper regulatory framework for blockchain technology could dissuade entrepreneurs, start-ups, and incumbents from deploying these new technologies for fear of stepping too early into untested waters.Only time will tell whether blockchains will transform and seep into the fabric of society, shaping an increasing range of social interactions and market transactions. If such a future comes to pass, the ideals of disintermediation, free markets, anarchy, and distributed collaboration could blur into each other, with lex cryptographica facilitating the emergence of new blockchain-based systems that are less dependent on the government, enabling capital and value to flow across the world in a more unconstrained manner.Law and code are two important regulatory mechanisms, each of which comes with its own benefits and limitations. The main drawbacks of the law â€” in terms of ambiguity and uncertainty â€” are also its greatest strengths, in that they provide legal and contractual rules with an increased degree of flexibility and adaptability. Similarly, the main advantages of smart contracts â€” in terms of automation and guaranteed execution â€” also constitute their greatest limitation, which might lead to excessive rigidity and an inability to keep pace with changing circumstances.As Yochai Benkler puts it, â€œThere are no spaces of perfect freedom from all constraintsâ€ â€” all we can do is choose between different types of constraints. While some people might be tempted to use blockchain technology to escape from the law, others might use it to establish an alternative or complementary system, made up of self-enforcing technical rules that are much more rigid and restraining than traditional legal rules.If blockchain technology matures, we may need to ask ourselves whether we would rather live in a world where most of our economic transactions and social interactions are constrained by the rules of law â€” which are universal but also more flexible and ambiguous, and therefore not perfectly enforceable â€” or whether we would rather surrender ourselves to the rules of code. Decentralized blockchain-based applications may well liberate us from the tyranny of centralized intermediaries and trusted authorities, but this liberation could come at the price of a much larger threat â€” that of falling under the yoke of the tyranny of code.----Harvard University Press--Harvard University Press--4Harvard University Press--Harvard University Press--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Unbecoming--768Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--121HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

With that passion in mind, I had a chance to attend my first Consumer Electronics Show to see what is on the horizon for the Custom Integration and Do It Yourself markets. Aside from meetings and events, it was thought-provoking to see that every industry is embracing the Internet of Things. I cannot tell you how many â€œSmart Homeâ€ or â€œAIâ€ banners I was wading through!From my perspective, a connected lifestyle is certainly the future across many verticals to make our lives more efficient. At the same time, it also raises questions about the sensitivity of user data and the morality of developing tech that will result in humanityâ€™s over-reliance on it. Here is what impressed and interested me the most at a crazy couple of days in Las Vegas.8K was everywhere and is going to transform how we consume content! Sony and LG had particularly impressive displays from a clarity as well as resolution perspectives. One of the most fascinating things I saw was the curved display from LG assembled to mimic the natural landscape of the waves and mountains flashing across its screen. Beyond being a jaw-dropper, it showcased that the entertainment space is expanding beyond even frame or mirror televisions to truly blend into your surroundings. The same could be said for their wheeled-display. I am sure we will see both sooner or later in a particularly eccentric clientâ€™s home.A portion of the show that was particularly interesting was the focus on virtual assistants. Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsungâ€™s Bixby had monstrous experience areas with â€œday in the lifeâ€ demos.The common theme I came away with was that everything was extremely controlled and closed off within these companies ecosystems of devices. This is a great business strategy to hook users on brand loyalty, Apple has been doing it for years, however it illustrates a challenge that our team faces on a daily basis. Our partners and projects demand a robust set of home automation features across a range of preferred brands. It will be difficult for our industry, and connected homes going forward, to rely on one brand due to the power of consumer choice.Maybe it is due to being surrounded by traffic in Los Angeles, however I was amazed by the strides being made in the electric automotive industry. Beyond that, the prototypes and alternatives to traditional transportation were awe-inspiring. Whether it was pods for smart cities or single-seated delivery carts there are a lot of players entering the automotive evolution.Also, the Bell Nexus air taxi gets a special shout out for being my real solution to traffic!Most Out There TechnologyThis is a toss up between Marvoto Technologyâ€™s fetus camera and the BeeLife Cocoon. However, both fulfill a need for families looking to become pregnant and endangered bees respectively. Both of these companies illustrate that every challenge has the potential to be a solved through software.TakeawaysLike any convention, it is always great to network with current partners and put names to faces for prospective ones. Although there was plenty of replicated technology and items that were not applicable for us, it was still a constructive couple of days checking out some fantastic technology. If anything, what I saw reinforced the need for one intuitive and easy to use user interface that works across brands.

Sometimes I perform on desktop mode in these social VR platforms, but Iâ€™ve always found it more rewarding actually performing in VR. Iâ€™m able to do this thanks to some of the features of the Loop Station and the Vive.I use the original Vive with the Deluxe Audio Strap when for VR. In the standard usage of the DAS, its headphones plugs straight into the Viveâ€™s hidden headphone jack as any set of headphones would. The headphone attachment being a standard 1/8 stereo connector is what makes my setup possible.Instead of plugging the connector on the DAS into the Vive, I plug it instead into a 3.5mm extension cable which I have strapped (kind of sloppily with zip ties) to the Vive 3-in-1 cable. This cable goes to my loop station using a 1/4 to 1/8 adapter. I also use the small extension wire that came with the original Vive strap to make it easy to switch between the Vive and my Loop Station as an audio source.The Loop Station has a built in USB audio interface and can be used as a soundcard. Plugging your headphones directly into the Loop Station, Iâ€™m able to hear my desktop audio, and monitor my loops and voice with whatever applied input effects I might be working with.In VRChat, I use the Loop Station as my playback source the whole time whether Iâ€™m on desktop with my gaming headset plugged in or using my Vive. I confirm the RC-505 is set to default playback before I launch my game through either the Windows Sound settings or Open VR Advanced Settings, depending what Iâ€™m doing. For the mic, I can switch easily within VRChatâ€™s settings window from the Vive Mic to my RC-505 so I donâ€™t have to hold my mic all the time.Some games may require a restart after changing the recording device in Windows. I have found this to be the case in AltspaceVR so I only ever use my Loop Station in desktop mode on that platform. I have a pretty good desktop stand for my mic.With everything set up the only difficulty I have is seeing my Loop Station, but I remedied that by just removing the flap that sits on your nose to block out light. The gap between my nose and the headset is wide enough that I can just look down and see everything clearly. If I had a big nose though, I imagine this would be difficult.When performing I try to hold my mic and controller in such a way that my hand on my avatar wonâ€™t just dangle next to me. This works fine with the old Vive controllers, but Iâ€™m not sure how I would do this with anything else. My other controller often gets sat down though making my Loop Station hand appear static in game.The Viveâ€™s Deluxe Audio Strap makes the whole experience live-looping in VR feel seamless. I donâ€™t have to slide a bulky headset over my headsets strap since the connector for the built-in headphones is easily accessible. The Vive Cosmos has its connector accessible as well, but other headsets like the Rift S and Valve Index do not. This simple feature has become the biggest determining factor for me when looking at newer VR headsets.----Mike P--Mike P----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Whether thatâ€™s with friends and family, at work, or alone the common denominator we all share is time. We all have places to be, things to do, and that small window of opportunity where we get to think to ourselves. But things get tricky with the notion of â€œfree time.â€ Coined as leisure, popular activities that are quickly associated with the term are putting oneâ€™s feet up or going for a casual walk. However, for millennials leisure has become an activity spent on phones, specifically social media accounts, most popularly, Instagram.The advertising industry has become a pillar of society and we cannot escape it. Search for something like books on Google and immediately, an ad for Barnes & Noble is the first search result, go to the explore tab or better yet, scroll for about five pictures on the Instagram news feed and notice an ad for a product you have never seen before or worse, a product related to that Burberry bag you had just talked to Alice aboutâ€¦I can understand why Kevin Systrom decided to leave Facebook. Being part of a company that continually strives to target users based directly off of algorithms catered towards peopleâ€™s individual likes and dislikes not only seems nosy but pushy. Please donâ€™t get me wrong, Instagram is a great product and app that enables its users to be more connected with their friends and perhaps what is happening in the world but when the platform absorbs much of your daily life for no apparent reason than the feeling of scrolling and viewing photos simply feels good I believe this is when things turn dangerous.I noticed that Snapchat as a company was beginning to show signs of what I view as a collapse when major executives left the company. I turned to using the app and really trying to get a sense for the user experience and compared it to Instagram which when adopted story capabilities has taken off even more. Our addiction stems off of the platformâ€™s user interface and user experience. The platform is extremely sticky, meaning that it is exciting to use and garners attention easily.I remember a time before smartphones were as ubiquitous when people would actually appear cognizant in front of other people. Human interaction seemed less intimidating and socially acceptable than today. Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong but I guess things have changed?As a Catholic, for Lent this year I decided that the best sacrifice I could make was to give up using Instagram. Wow, have the results been astonishing. Now that I donâ€™t have Instagram on my phone anymore I am literally allocating my focus and time more effectively. As an investor in Facebook, this is quite a contradiction. If I believe in the companyâ€™s ability to generate more and more sales over time and their overall mission, shouldnâ€™t I treat the products they have as a priority?Gary Vaynerchuk seems to be the epitome of being a successful businessman while making a living out of social media. How could someone be so productive and successful with Vayner X and everything heâ€™s running? It has to do with a team of assistants posting on the platform for him and a healthy balance of doing what he loves every day which is inspiring the next generation via social media.Recently, at Hardware Con one of the panelists had said, â€œI think the future of vacations is when people say I went to the woods without my phone.â€ This drew chucks and giggles from the audience but no one thought it was farfetched. Having worked in Silicon Valley, ridden fancy tech buses and experienced a culture centered around building the next best technology products, itâ€™s safe to say that our lives have become digitized.What I Found Remarkable: I was happier and more connected with my self than I had been in a while. The best part was I paying attention to people around me and truly feeling connected with the world. I believe that phone addiction disrupts our ability to have empathy. I think empathy is what makes us human. In 200 years humans may evolve based off of our current behaviors and not know how to display feelings like love, compassion, and anything else that distinguishes a living being from a material object. We already see the manifestation through dating apps, texting domination, and lack of organic conversation.Yuval Noah Harari predicts a future where humans become cyborgs meaning that half man half robot isnâ€™t as distant of a reality that it may seem.â€œBe on the verge.â€ â€” Dan of Bahia VergeIf you found this article to be of any value, please share using the social media links below.----Where reflection and technology collide.

Itâ€™s only a matter of time. Over the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve been trying to find all the big visions around AR out there and was somewhat disappointed by the result.Most of the openly communicated ideas for future AR applications are rather uncreative.I believe that augmented reality has the power to change everything: the world we experience, the devices we use on a daily basis and the internet as we know it today. This might be the end of your smartphone, the end of your TV and maybe the end of bullshit ads and fake news.In this article Iâ€™d like to share my most innovative, promising and eye-opening ideas around AR applications. But before that, let me briefly explain why I think AR can have such a huge impact.Augmented reality basically describes the way we experience the world with our human senses but enhanced and augmented by technology. In my opinion, the killer app is AR glasses, enabling you to see and hear an augmented world. Simply put: You can see things, which are placed into the real world and you can interact with them, but they arenâ€™t physically there and youâ€™re the only one seeing them. Youâ€™ll be walking through an augmented world.Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Magic Leap and lots of other companies are currently working hard on AR. There is a lot of money involved and everybody tries to create the â€œnew iPhoneâ€ â€” the hardware and operating system of the future. But up to now, it still hasnâ€™t lifted off and reached the broad masses. This is probably because the technology (the hardware and software) isnâ€™t yet on a level that can hit the market with full power. Too bulky, bad screen quality, only little sight coverage, computation intensive environment detection, etc.What are the challenges in making AR glasses suitable for everyday use? There are some key factors, such as: environment detection and motion tracking; rendering images from 3D models for both eyes in parallel on a translucent display in the highest resolution possible; spatial sound; rethinking of our interaction with software through gestures. If you take that further, itâ€™s also about adjusting the 3D objects according to the current lightning conditions; adjusting the sound according to your surroundings; detecting objects being visually in front of rendered 3D models and hiding parts of them. And putting this technology in a rather small device on your nose (or at least a part of it).â€žOk, sounds cool, but what do I need AR for? Maybe itâ€˜s useful for navigation or for some industrial applications like in plane assembly lines, or for a doctor but not for me.â€œ Meeep, wrong! You will be surprised. Letâ€™s check some my ideas, maybe theyâ€™ll change your mind.Take these ideas as inspirations and to get a feeling for the power of AR. Feel free to grab one of the ideas to start and grow a billion-dollar company (youâ€™ll owe me a beer at my favorite bar in Hamburg).Where is the sense in carrying around a rather small display device in your pocket when you can have 3D displays everywhere you look, as big as you want, optimized for whatever youâ€™re currently doing?How about an iPhone triple Max in your hand and as soon as you close your hand itâ€˜s gone. Or a piano keyboard when you want to play the piano? There is no sense in carrying around a (smartphone-)display anymore. The device nowadays being known as smartphone will be overtaken as soon as AR glasses become mainstream. Sure, the displays wonâ€™t have such a high resolution in the beginning as a smartphone and probably gesture control and sight coverage wonâ€™t be perfect right away, but like every disruptive technology, itâ€™ll outperform the smartphone by its benefits very soon.Just imagine checking the time by just raising your wrist and a super cool virtual watch shows you the time as well as your next appointments. Or you can stick notes to real-life objects like your front door, or your carâ€™s door handle. Or something like this:And 3D displays and UIs are so much cooler than the flat ones we know today, anyway.Just like the smartphone, a TV is basically just a display. With AR glasses you wouldnâ€™t need a TV at home anymore, because you are carrying it on your nose. You can position the TV in every size and shape in every part of your apartment or wherever you go. Bathtub? Bed? Kitchen? You can basically turn a whole wall in your living room into a big 3D movie which also changes perspective when you move in the room. Which brings me right to my next point.Decorative items, furniture styles, lighting, ambient atmosphere, this could all be virtually enhanced and could change automatically for example depending on your mood or if itâ€™s your birthday. You will be able to put insta filters on just about everything.Turn a whole wall of your apartment into a live 3D view of earth from the ISS, or a beautiful view on a Norwegian fjord on a foggy autumn morning. I personally also like the idea of looking out of a huge window of a skyscraper of Coruscant (the planet-covering city in the Star Wars movies).There might be virtual light switches whenever you enter a room and the lights are off, or you leave the room and the light is still on. Touching the switches toggles your Philips Hue lights in the room.Just image to have animated decoration elements. There will be huge virtual market around these kinds of delighting home and world accessories. And with some mood detection, really amazing experiences might be possible.Imagine you could try the new camera you want to buy without leaving your couch. Grab it, turn it around, change some lenses, attach some add-ons, check the color or size you want, flip through the menus â€” sweet! The manufacturer gives you a virtual device to help you make your decision.Maybe they even add some more atmosphere and a virtual onboarding with some nice arrows and animations showing you how to use the product.I bet most of the hardware manufacturers in a couple of years will feel the need to add AR content to their products because it becomes common â€” especially in the toy industry. Also purely virtual â€žphysicalâ€œ products might be a thing, like the mentioned virtual piano keyboard.Just creating something like a platform for AR product onboardings is probably a huge business case on its own.With the power of artificial intelligence, we can already tell a lot about a certain object, just by a picture. How about showing the calories of a dish by looking at it. Or the ripeness of the avocado you have in your hand, or the authenticity of an image you are seeing in the news, or an aggregated, independent opinion about the validity of a statement you are reading on the bus.We could see more than we do right now and use common sense to not be cheated as easily.When moving through modern cities, you are surrounded by ads. They are everywhere, trying to grab your attention and incept an idea of a product or brand into your mind. There are ad blockers for your browser, and you can mute your TV or YouTube spots. But in the real world, only looking away helps. With AR glasses and some AI ad detection, these could be easily grayed out â€” or replaced by something more valuable.Static ads on billboards and busses etc. are only weakly targeted. We could al-so move to an age, where these billboards arenâ€˜t around but everybody sees a targeted ad in their augmented world, suitable to their needs and buying behavior.You probably know the situation in a restaurant when you cannot decide on a dish, right? Or maybe youâ€˜re asking yourself how big it is? With AR your restaurant might offer you a preview of the dish, right on your plate. You could basically flip through the dishes in front of you and pinch them to the right size (with some AI scaling the content not the 3D model, this could look really natural).When receiving the dish, you could even enhance it with some nice decoration and virtual sauces or other visually appealing ingredients. Or you get a virtual explanation on how to creak that lobster correctly.How about a virtual pet, maybe a small dragon or the never growing puppy from your dreams? It interacts with you. Itâ€˜s running around the house, does lots of funny stuff without destroying anything. It grabs you attention, itâ€˜s there when you feel alone and itâ€˜s not a problem at all if you donâ€™t have time for it. This might be a whole new pet experience with lots of benefits and only very little downsides of owning a pet.With AI technology, the pet could definitely learn from its environment, its experiences and could be a totally unique part of your family.Why not play a jump & run game while you walk to the bus. Having Mario right on the sidewalk in front of you. Small Mario jumping around, collecting some coins, fully dynamic depending on your speed and your environment.Even more augmented: collecting household points when you clean up, do the laundry, carry down the waste bag. A gamification of the everyday boring things might be fun and motivate you to be more caring.How about a small virtual assistant in the form of a 3D robot, or fable animal that assists you with your everyday chores. It helps you find what youâ€™re looking for in the supermarket; shows you the way in the train station; shows you where you left your car keys; knocks on the door politely and reminds you when you need to leave to pick up your daughter from school. This would be so much more humane than Alexa or a smartphone reminder.An idea going into that direction was published in 2018 by Google when they introduced the fox as a virtual assistant for their AR maps.They are already there! You can buy different kinds of AR glasses. But, as mentioned above, I think the technology is not yet on a superior level compared to smartphones. Technology s-curves describe this phenomenon very well. One technology is not yet strong enough to replace the older one, but there will be a time when it disrupts the existing status quo and the older technology dies out.If you check e.g. Appleâ€™s, Microsoftâ€™s and Facebookâ€™s recent developments in the field of AR technology, it feels like we are getting much closer to that disruptive moment. I definitely want one pair of glasses desperately.If you havenâ€™t experienced the cool feeling of interacting with virtual 3D objects, yet, go to the next tech store and try on some VR glasses like the Oculus Quest â€” itâ€™s completely virtual reality but the first-time experience is really mind blowing.Let me know what nice applications for AR you have on your mind!If you become a billionaire with one of these ideas or just had a good read and feel well prepared for the next AR small talk: Leave a clap! ðŸ‘----3The StartupVisionary futurist, creative mind, engineer + MBA, founder of awork.io, into Robots, AI, AR, Food 2.0 ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªðŸ’¡ðŸ§ Lucas BaucheinBootcamp--Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Nitin SharmainThe Startup--88Lucas Bauche--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Avi Bar-ZeevinPredict--2Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Scott H.

73,34240,https://medium.com/@tinytechzines/technology-in-argentina-8522ac0210eb?source=tag_archive---------120-----------------------,Technology in Argentina,None,Tiny Tech Zines,https://medium.com/@tinytechzines,6,1,0,"Tiny Tech ZinesFollow--ListenShareInterview by Rachel Simanjuntak for Tiny Tech ZinesI met Gonzalo Moiguer while attending the School for Poetic Computation in New York City. Gonza is an Argentina-native artist and technologist. He is one of many students that travel from outside of the U.S. to attend sfpc. I learned a lot while studying alongside him and deeply respect his curiosity and approach to technology. I invited Gonza to have a conversation about the tech community in Buenos Aires, hoping to understand a little more about how the U.S. tech industry is viewed from the outside, how our technology funnels into other countries, and what the contrasts are. This is Gonzaâ€™s perspective on these questions.Letâ€™s start at the beginning. How did you become interested in working with technology?Since I was a kid, playing with programmable Legos, later studying film and now as a programmer, tech has always had an important role in my work process. I think what has deeply changed, and defines my different moments are the questions that I ask technology. I would describe my recent works as asking â€œhow much do we need it?â€What kind of tech communities exist in Buenos Aires?Iâ€™m mostly surrounded by two large communities, gaming and electronic art, both of which overlap.Where do those communities gather?Parties. Most cultural spaces tend to rely on throwing parties from time to time, as it is a safe and reliable way to gather money. It ends up being common to attend lectures or workshops that once they finish the space gets redone as a dance floor in a matter of minutes, and attendees are always welcome to stay. I find this to be an honest and true way to meet people in the same communities.How did you find this community?My starting point was the University of Buenos Aires where I studied Sound and Vision Design. I would describe it as being more philosophical about the images, rather than technology in itself. Nonetheless, a perfect and diverse environment full of very smart colleagues and teachers where my head exploded with knowledge and I grew significantly.How would you describe the current technology landscape in Argentina?Access to technology is just another evidence of inequality in Argentina. Sadly, the digitization of most jobs also means growing economic and educational gaps between people who have access to technology education and find tech intuitive to use, and people who donâ€™t. Recently, our Trump-aligned president criticized the former presidentâ€™s â€œA laptop per childâ€ initiative on the basis that most of the laptops didnâ€™t have internet connectivity and would therefore be useless. He ultimately cancelled the initiative. This is an example of the people in charge confusing technology education with apps and startup culture.In terms of technology, where do you see the biggest disconnection between Argentina and the U.S.?In Argentina, as in most developing countries, internet companies have little presence in the real world. Unless you are in a busy part of a big city, itâ€™s unlikely to see an ad for Google, Facebook or any other. Web companies tend to only exist virtually. Itâ€™s important to constantly remind ourselves that any software-driven interaction was thought of and designed by real people in real places. When studying at the School for Poetic Computation, my daily commute consisted of getting off at 14th Street and walking by Googleâ€™s headquarters. I could witness the real people running late to work, or leaving exhausted, just like any of us. When youâ€™re not reminded of that, itâ€™s easy to think of any of these companies as a black box of ones and zeros making calculated decisions.Where does Argentinaâ€™s tech news come from?I donâ€™t find mass media in Argentina to be specifically interested in technology, other than bits on apps or gadgets. So our tech news tends to be consumed from big, centralized U.S. blogs and sites.The first, and ongoing TV segment dedicated to tech in Argentina, is TN Tecno, but theyâ€™ve been around for so long that they have ultimately become two old guys who know nothing about technology, reviewing gaming hardware. The episodes available online constitute a big part of ironic consumption.What topics are currently dominating Argentinaâ€™s tech conversation?Right now thereâ€™s a big debate as the right wing parties try to push for electronic voting. My worries are related to the point I stated before, about the risk of tech companies seeming invisible. They try to make the point that software is something inevitable, that these machines are dumb printers. An interesting phenomenon in the world of technology is that youâ€™ll find most people against electronic voting to be coders, software, hardware engineers. You donâ€™t usually see people fighting against the growth of their own field of expertise.What brings tech into the country?Computers are very expensive here. This awful restriction has given way to online communities of people traveling and doing favours for each other. It has become a social practice to buy laptops during our travels and bringing them to friends looking to get one.What was it like studying technology in New York vs. Argentina?I think one of the most interesting differences I witnessed when studying abroad is the importance given to low-tech. Given the growing dominance of technology in every aspect of our lives and relationships I found it very helpful to traverse down the layers of abstraction given by UI, tools, libraries and programming languages, to understand whatâ€™s really going on at the transistor level.How did sfpc affect your art practice in Argentina?I would say before sfpc I was much more obsessed with the way cutting edge, latest technologies, formats and tools would shape the future of art. After taking a closer look at the politics and implications of the industrial and commercial processes of electronics with Ed Bear and Taeyoon Choi, I feel I acquired an enormous respect to incredible small and powerful actors, such as resistors, transistors, capacitors, etc. This new relationship to technological components affected the rest of my art practice, paying more attention to the small components of coding, the beauty of the loop and the conditional. I have since started a workshop on procedural drawings for coders and non-coders, where the idea is to write instructions for drawings, much like in conditional design, and to reflect about the way these two components create emergent behaviours from a few instructions into complex shapes.Now that you are back home, how do you hope to contribute to the tech scene in Argentina?I hope my contributions come in the path of education. I learned at sfpc that education and working closely, building with a community are a real and effective way to change the things we find to be bad in our society.And finally, do you think better access to tech and tech education would affect Argentina in a positive way?I absolutely think so, and it is essential in our history of tensions between colonizers-natives, which is deep down in our identity. This has taken many shapes throughout time, such as Spaniards and Natives; British/US and Argentinians; and now a complex panorama of digital colonialism where the actors involved are still blurry, but the goal is still the same: to subject Latin America to Monroeâ€™s Doctrine of â€œAmericaâ€™s backyardâ€. The Cambridge Analytica scandal influenced our latest election, which allowed a president who won by a close margin to reshape our whole country for the benefit of US/European interests.In this scenario, the education of the reaches of social media and their inner workings is extremely valuable. Because internet companies have little physical presence, itâ€™s important to remind ourselves that apps arenâ€™t just apps, code isnâ€™t just code, these are companies made by people, mostly seeking profit, and the tools are designed and optimized to generate the most amount of revenue.This system perpetuates a single history, one that is not our own. One possibility is to rely less on worldwide communities run by huge companies from abroad, and to work on small networks, similar to the first internet. I currently work closely with two projects that I feel are headed in this direction, both run by artist Gabriel Rud: One is the closed social media for university teachers and students to share their current work and references they work with. The other is proyectoidis.org, a research project for media art archeology, where we mix the great, popular artists and their work with less known latin american artists.These kind of projects are a vital way of telling an alternative history, one made by ourselves. As artists, especially working with technology, this is the political role we have in the path of self determination.----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

But only the minority knows what is the Great Firewall of China. And if youâ€™ve gotten to this article, you probably want to overcome it. Luckily, there is a way to do that. I call it China proxy.China proxy is just a real residential IPs or data center proxies from China. Iâ€™ve dived into the proxy world in order to find the best China proxy providers. Here is my list of top 5 China proxy providers for 2019:Smartproxy has taken the 1st place for one simple reason: good quality-price ratio. They have more than 70,000 unique residential IPs in China. All of them are going through legit mobile and desktop devices in different locations. Smartproxy offers unlimited connections and session control: you can select the rotating session and get a new IP address with every connection request or use the sticky sessions to keep an IP for up to 10 minutes. Smartproxy pricing model is based on subscription with traffic consumption limits. To get more information about their residential proxies, read my Smartproxy review.Compared to the competitors, Luminati has one of the biggest proxy pools in China â€” over 260,000 IPs including residential, mobile and datacenter proxies. This pool is highly impacted by Hola VPN service, in return for free usage, your residential IP address is being added to their P2P pool. Because of this, Luminati has advanced geo-distribution and can target many different cities. However, their service prices might be too high for single users. The cheapest subscription costs $500 per month.Oxylabs is a tech company specializing in large-scale web data extraction and webpage crawling. They have a massive proxy pool in China with over 208,000 residential and datacenter IPs. Oxylabs has a unique product called Real-Time Crawler (RTC) which makes scraping look easy. After selecting some parameters, you will receive formatted and ready to use data. Oxylabs support HTTP/HTTPs and SOCKS 5 protocols. However, the same as Luminati, they might be too expensive for single users.GeoSurf is another great proxy provider with over 14,000 residential proxy IPs in China. Their residential proxy pool is based on a P2P Network, this means you can send unlimited parallel requests through millions of verified working IPs. Geosurf allows you to manage sessions by choosing between rotating and sticky session which can last as long as your IP address will change automatically. GeoSurf pricing starts from $450 and is based on subscription with data consumption limits.RSocks took the last place because of their small proxy pool size and limited features. They offer personal IPv4 proxy packs with more than 3,000 IPs in China. Good thing is that up to 20% of their proxies are being updated every 2 hours and have a quite small load. However, they are limited by threads and locations.Whether you want to scrape the web or access country-specific content behind the Great Firewall of China, there is no better solution than China proxy. Unlike free china proxy, which can be found on the internet, these 5 listed providers can guarantee you top-notch services. So if you want to stay safe online and get the best results, choose a trusted China proxy network.----Networking enthusiastNeil Alpert--Neil Alpert----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Scott H.

78,32994,https://medium.com/@asimraissiddiqui/nfc-technology-reaches-new-horizons-with-ios-13-d84c6ef1509b?source=tag_archive---------72-----------------------,NFC Technology Reaches New Horizons with iOS 13,None,Asim Rais Siddiqui,https://medium.com/@asimraissiddiqui,4,3,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Dlaf8QRQGbeIClkbGcNukg.jpeg","Asim Rais SiddiquiFollow--ListenShareAt the 2019 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, the worldâ€™s leading tech company, Apple Inc., announced the launch of its iOS 13 this fall. The new technology will support NFC tags in Apple Pay, and enable special features in other applications.Unlike its predecessors that could only read NFC tags, this framework allows developers to write directly on blank tags through third party apps, and allow tag interactions through Native Protocols. Additional support includes the ability to develop applications that can read passports and contactless smartcards, such as those used in Japan, and interactions with NFC enabled hardware.Background NFC tag reading is native without an application, but has to be NDEF formatted. In iOS 13 Apple has extended this with support for new standards in its Core NFC Framework. These include Mifare, FeliCa, ISO 7816 (e.g. for passports, transit and contactless smart cards), and ISO 15693. It is not known if Apple will support the NFC Forumâ€™s latest TNEP standard.The U.K. governmentâ€™s NFC passport reader app, ReadID, will now work on the iPhone as a result of these updates.What NFC will mean for users:The wide array of possibilities that sound this upgrade involves the integration of shortcuts that were previously only possible through specific applications. The ability to launch shortcuts is now part of the iOS 13 and requires no specific application but can only work with pre-programmed NFC tags.The NFC tag reading is native without an application. While there are no native tag writing applications, this can be done through third party apps, a restriction that existed in previous versions of the iOS.This feature can be used to transfer data or information, trigger set tasks and actions within a device which could be based on timing, geo-location, or tasks embedded within an NFC tag. Users will also have the option to lockdown information on a tag, making it impossible to re-write.The utility of NFC:For developers this is exciting news because for the first time, they will be able to use applications to define their own NFC tags through. As a Launch Center Pro (LCP) developer, David Barnard recently tweeted that it will be possible for firms to write on blank NFC stickers.This provides developers the option to program NFC tags to complete tasks. While users themselves donâ€™t usually write their own tags, developers can explore different avenues to allow businesses to improve efficiency in their processes, and for people to create more convenient ways to carry out daily tasks.In addition to this, the iPhone did not previously support sharing of data and files by tapping two devices together. This has been updated, allowing users to share music files, videos and documents with the use of the NFC function in their device.In daily life, this would allow standard activities to be automated, such as sending a daily message, setting a fixed alarm and performing other similar tasks, with a swipe of your phone over an NFC tag.At a more complex level, this could also be used to execute multi-step workflows involving multiple actions. For example, putting your device on silent, shutting off the Wi-Fi and dimming screen brightness and background app functions, as one swipes their phone at the NFC tag before they leaving their office. Similarly, your NFC tag could switch on your Bluetooth and connect to the carâ€™s speakers, open a map to your workplace and play your favorite songs, without you having to do these tasks individually.The applications of such a technology are never ending, and with the ability to write your own commands, users will have greater autonomy to define their own tags and purpose.This technology is anticipated to be equally useful in the retail sector, as it promotes efficiency in processes, and improves transparency between producer and consumer. Product owners can code NFCs to send data regarding a product, its value, purpose and other details through an NFC tag attached to their body that users can swipe, to access all the information. This reduces the need for manual labor and creates an efficient experience for buyers. Practical applications include generating restaurant menus on device, or feedback forms for customers to fill out.The normalization of such technology can enable loyalty packages and gift vouchers for users, allowing businesses to market themselves in a tech-savvy and innovative way that works on the spot, and eliminates old-age use of token cards and vouchers.    The positioning of NFC as a standard technologyOne of the questions surrounding Appleâ€™s announcement is regarding the wide-scale use of NFC tags in peopleâ€™s private and professional lives, and whether or not this will succeed in global markets. As of now, one thing is for certain, with Appleâ€™s market share and ability to set trends that transform the tech and business landscapes around the world, Apple plans to establish NFC as standard technology across industries.One of the limitations that Apple has enforced is that there is still no support for NFC tag-based payments, to ensure that the market for Apple Pay isnâ€™t damaged, and is left unchallenged. The company has announced that NFC tags will be able to trigger transactions through Apple Pay.With the endless scope of NFCs application across businesses, there is significant promise for its integration into most peopleâ€™s daily lives. Multiple places have already started adopting contactless payment through Apple Pay, and this is only the beginning of a larger, wide-scale movement in favor of the technology. While similar technology has existed in the past, Appleâ€™s own involvement is likely to boost this facility, as businesses strive to keep up with the trend and explore avenues for improved consumer accessibility and convenience.----An innovative business technologist and strategist, and over 10 years of experience, he helps build scalable platforms and disruptive businesses.Asim Rais Siddiqui--Asim Rais Siddiqui----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Josep FerrerinGeek Culture--72Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"
80,42127,https://medium.com/@datarails/how-to-positively-embrace-change-in-your-organization-b2829756d2?source=tag_archive---------149-----------------------,How To Positively Embrace Change in Your Organization,1. Adjust your attitude,Sarah,https://medium.com/,3,0,1,"SarahFollow--ListenShareThe 5 insights that helped me make my digital transformation as smooth as possible.If you donâ€™t like change, you will like irrelevance even less. â€” General Eric ShinsekiThe wind of change is blowing. In fact, this is the only wind you can be sure will stick around. In todayâ€™s modern workplace, this change comes in the form of technology. Beloved by some, feared by most. No matter how you feel about it, if you fail to embrace it you can be sure of one thing: you will get left behind.Many executives are concerned about the ground-shaking, earth-rumbling, seismic waves that are coming. But in the face of disruption, while it may feel instinctual, leaders canâ€™t afford to freeze. To ensure the survival of their organization, leaders need to understand the challenges, and more importantly the benefits, of impending changes. For their organizationâ€™s sake, leaders need to address them head on.   We are conditioned to prefer stability and respond to change with fear and disorientation. However, there is plenty we can do to prepare ourselves. Below, here are my top tips for embracing the inevitable.One of the hardest things about change is how it makes us feel. Using a new tool or implementing a new system is like trying to ride a bike for the first time: scary. Being a beginner means youâ€™ll be asking a lot of questions, performing actions slowly, and making a lot of mistakes. These very points are why it is so critical that you have the right attitude.Prepare yourself for the difficulties by acknowledging that they will in fact exist. Engaging in self-talk is one way to do so. For example, instead of thinking â€œI donâ€™t want this, Iâ€™ll just stick with what I know,â€ try saying to yourself â€œthis may not be pleasant at first, but itâ€™s a worthwhile long-term investment.â€Acknowledge that things will be hard at first but the discomfort will pass, and in its place will come a newfound sense of success and accomplishment.The outset of the journey will be laden with mistakes, and youâ€™ll undoubtedly experience a rocky start. However, itâ€™s important to accept these errors as a part of the process. Things may start off poorly, but they will get better. Exponentially.Enthusiasm is contagious. Provide your employees with the support they need in order to take your organization to the next level. Implement learning systems that make it easy for employees to learn the skills they need in order to work with the latest software, systems, and tools.Everyone appreciates some positive feedback. Give other employees a pat on the back by vocally recognizing their small accomplishments. Theyâ€™ll appreciate your recognition of their achievements, and you in turn will see the small steps made on the road to mastery.And finally, and probably most important of all-Remember- you are an ambassador of your organization. For this very reason it is vital that you pass on the torch of change acceptance to other employees. Promote the adoption of change by introducing new technologies. Be open to hearing about new potentialities. Encourage learning. This approach will enhance productivity and make sure you are keeping up with the times. Donâ€™t forget- how fast you embrace evolving technologies will determine the place of your organization in your industryâ€™s roster.Change can be hard to accept, but it is vital for the survival of your business no matter what industry youâ€™re in. For this reason, it is best you try to make the transition as smooth as possible. Remember- how fast you embrace and incorporate modern technologies will determine your place in the market.----Blogger with a passion for finance.Sarah--Sarah--Sarah--Sarah--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alex Mathers--220Tobias Charles--29Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Scott H.

81,56593,https://medium.com/iot-hub-africa/technology-trends-affecting-iot-5df77f039a1f?source=tag_archive---------129-----------------------,Technology trends affecting IoT,None,felicity Mecha,https://medium.com/@felicitymecha_99001,5,143,0,"felicity MechaFollowIoT-hub Africa--ListenShareEvery technology is affected greatly by different trends. Today we shall examine the different trends in different areas that will directly have an effect on the Internet of Things(IoT) technology.Technological and scientific advances and breakthroughs are occurring across a number of disciplines at an increasing pace. Below is a brief description of the science and technology advances that have a direct rele-vance to IoTThis science has a large impact across a vast range of industries, from pharmaceutical and cosmetics to electronics. MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) can be used to build advanced micro-sized sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes. Emerging flexible and printable electronics will enable a new range of innovations for embedding technology in the realworld. New materials provide different methods to develop and manufacture a large range of different sensors and actuators, as well as being used in applica- tions for environmental control, water purification Additionally, we will see other innovative uses such as smart textiles that will provide the capability to produce the next generation of wearable technologies.These are the tools that are autonomous or semi-autonomous. These are found in a number of different industries such as, robots and very advanced machinery is used in different harsh environments, such as deep-sea exploration, or in the mining industry . Advanced machines have many modalities, and operate with a combination of local autonomous capabilities as well as remote control. Sensing and actuation are key technologies, and local monitor-control loops for routine tasks are required in addition to reliable communications for remote operations. Often such solutions require real-time characteristics. These systems will continue to evolve and automate tasks today performed by humans.This is relevant to IoT for two reasons. Firstly, it relates to the global interest of securing the availability of electricity while reducing climate and environmental impacts. Smart Grids, for example, imply micro-generation of electricity using affordable photovoltaic panels. In addition, smart grids also require new types of energy storage, both for the grid itself and for emerging technologies such as Electric Vehicles (EVs) that rely on increasingly efficient battery technologies. Secondly, powering embedded devices in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) will increasingly rely on different energy harvesting technologies and also rely on new miniaturized battery technologies and ultra capacitors. As these technologies improve, IoT will be applicable in a broad range of scenarios that need long battery life.Today, sensors, actuators, and tags function as the digital interfaces to the physical world. Small-scale and cheap sensors and actuators provide a bridge between the physical realm and ICT systems. Tags using technologies such as RFID provide the means to put electronic identities on any object, and can be cheaply produced.Embedded processing is evolving, not only towards higher capabilities and processing speeds, but also extending towards the smallest of applications. There is a growing market for small-scale embedded processing such as 8-, 16-, and 32-bit microcontrollers with on-chip RAM and flash memory, I/O capabilities, and networking interfaces that are integrated on tiny System-on-a-Chip (SoC) solutions. These enable very constrained devices with a small footprint of a few mm 2 and very low power consumption (in the milli- to micro-Watt range), yet are still capable of hosting an entire TCP/IP stack including a small web server.Instant access to the Internet is available virtually everywhere today, mainly thanks to wireless and cellular technologies and the rapid deployment of cellular 3G and 4G or Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems on a global scale. These systems provide ubiquitous and relatively cheap connectivity with the right characteristics for many applications, including low latency and the capacity to handle large amounts of data with high reliability. Bluetooth Low Energy, andPower Line Communication (PLC) solutions to reach even the most cost sensitive deployments and tiniest devices.Software architectures have undergone several evolutions over the past decades, in particular with the increasing dominance of the web paradigm. Open APIs provide a simple mechanism for developers to access the functionality of the platform in question. Over time, these platforms, due to the increasing use and power of the Internet, have become open platforms ones that do not depend on certain programming languages or lock-in between platform developers and platform owners.Software development has started applying the web paradigm and using a service-oriented approach (SOA). By extending the web paradigm to IoT devices, they can become a natural component of building any application and facilitate an easy integration of IoT device servicesinto any enterprise system that is based on the SOA (e.g. that uses web services or RESTful interfaces). IoT applications can then become technology and programming language independent. This will help boost the IoT application development market. A key component in establishing the application development market is Open APIs.Open APIs, in the same way that they have been critical to the development of the web, will be just as important to the creation of a successful IoT market, and we can already see developments in this space. Put simply, Open APIs relate to a common need to create a market between many companies, as is the case in the IoT market. Open APIs permit the creation of a fluid industrial platform, allowing components to be combined together in multiple different ways by multiple developers with little to no interaction with those who developed the platform, or installed the devices.Without Open APIs, a developer would need to create contracts with several different companies in order to get access to the correct data to develop the application. The transaction costs associated with establishing such a service would be prohibitively expensive for most small development companies; they would need to establish contracts with each company for the data required, and spend time and money on legal fees and business development with each individual company.virtualization has many different facets and has gained a lot of attention in the past few years, even though it has been around for a rather long time. The cloud computing paradigm, with different as a Service models, is one of the greatest aspects of the evolution of ICT for IoT as it allows virtualized and independent execution environments for multiple applications to reside in isolation on the same hardware platform, and usually in large data centers.Closely related to the topic of data centers, data processing and intelligent software will have an increasing role to play in IoT solutions. A popular concept now is big data, which refers to the increasing number and size of data sets that are available for companies and individuals to collect and perform analysis on. Built on large-scale computing, data storage, in-memory processing, and analytics, big data is intended to find insights in the massive data sets produced. Naturally, these technologies are therefore key enablers for IoT, as they allow the collation and aggrega- tion of the massive datasets that devices and sensors are likely to produce.the IoT market holds incredible promise for solving big problems for industry, society, and even individuals. One key thing to note, however, is the tremendous complexity that such systems need to handle in order to function efficiently and effectively. Partnerships and alliances are therefore critical no one company will be able to produce all the technology and software required to deliver IoT solutions. Moreover, no one company will be able to house the innovativecapacity required to develop new solutions for this market. IoT solutions bring together devices, networks, applications, software platforms, cloud computing platforms, business processing systems, knowledge management, visualization, and advanced data analysis techniques. This is quite simply not possible at scale without significant levels of system integration and standards development.----IoT-hub Africafelicity MechainIoT-hub Africa--felicity MechainIoT-hub Africa--felicity MechainIoT-hub Africa--felicity MechainIoT-hub Africa--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Scott H.

85,32759,https://medium.com/@junis_alico/qrc-quality-reliability-consistency-the-three-pillars-of-a-great-software-product-b8c5d556f187?source=tag_archive---------37-----------------------,"QRC (Quality, Reliability, Consistency): The Three Pillars of a Great Software Product",None,Junis Alico,https://medium.com/@junis_alico,5,1,1,"Junis AlicoFollow--ListenShareAfter a number of years leading software product development teams and also personally being part of such teams in various industries, building websites, apps, integration systems, etc., I have come to realize that there are three guiding principles behind every truly great software product. They are Quality, Reliability, and Consistency. These three seemingly simple, yet powerful ideologies make up what I call the QRC system, and they have come to guide me in creating products that have earned national recognition. If these three pillars are consistently followed throughout the SDLC process â€” not just during QA testing â€” the end product is almost always something amazing. Neglect any of them, and your product will be in chaos, resulting in unhappy users, countless bugs, numerous downtimes, and unhappy investors. Make QRC part of every product iteration, improvement, user story, use case, or workflow and you will see tangible, measurable product success.So what does the QRC system include?Any software product, no matter how large or small, has to have quality. Quality is the productâ€™s ability to fully satisfy the userâ€™s needs and to have him/her feel a sense of accomplishment after the product/feature use. This might seem intuitive and easy to achieve, but the majority of software products, either as a whole or in part, do not conform to this ideology. Although most products fulfill usersâ€™ needs, they do not do so with quality. Users are usually left wanting something more out of their experience. This could be anything from better, more appealing visual design to easier navigation to simpler workflows.For example, a bank user may want to deposit a check using his/her smartphone. After downloading the app and authenticating, s/he is left flustered by how to actually go about depositing. Some apps do not have an easy way to access the deposit feature, contrary to what they may advertise. After navigating through a plethora of options, the user may finally find the right place to begin the deposit. Before s/he could do so, however, the user has to first manually fill in all the check information (amount, account to deposit to, etc.) and to take a picture of the front and back of the check.In this scenario, the user may have been able to achieve his/her goal of depositing a check, but the bank app did not provide a quality experience. At the end of the interaction with the app, the user was most likely left wanting more â€” easier, faster way to find the deposit feature, not having to complete information manually and have the app extract it from the picture, etc. Thinking through this customer journey, planning for it in advance, and ultimately adding features that would not only address the basic usersâ€™ needs but would also enhance their satisfaction would increase the Q (Quality) in the bankâ€™s app.It goes without saying that a product has to be reliable. R (Reliability) in a software product is the ability of the product provider to have the product up and running and available at all times in all necessary places. Reliability in this sense could be synonymous with product availability. However, reliability is a more appropriate term to use because a product could be available (up and running) but not accessible or usable in any way. Reliability ensures that the product is both available and usable.Every day, major services are being hacked and, therefore, not available and not usable. Heavy loads crash sites constantly and consistently. Many products have issues with integrations, time zone changes, prolonged maintenance windows, and more. This is not reliable! The user has to be able to rely on the product at all times and has to have the confidence that when s/he navigates to a site, opens an app, uses a desktop application, the product will be there to serve and work without bugs.Consistency, in my opinion, is the most important pillar of the QRC system. Product consistency is the ability of the product to do what it was designed to do at all times, with no variations, ALWAYS. Simply put, the product as a whole, or a single feature, must do one thing and do it well.Products have bugs, they crash. Features disappear, become unavailable. Users get different results depending on how they use the product. Data inconsistencies plague modern software. Integrations are unreliable. These and an almost infinite number of reasons cause products to be inconsistent. This simply cannot happen and, as software product developers, we must not find it acceptable. Software must consistently achieve its purpose without fail.Imagine a piece of software deployed in a hospital, in an ICU. Medical personnel â€” doctors, nurses, staff â€” deal with immense amounts of pressure on a daily basis. They have to get things right because human lives are at risk. Imagine a glucose injection piece of software miscalculating injection dose on a critical patient. The consequences would be disastrous. The software provider must take all risks factors into consideration to ensure consistency of the product at all times.My ICU example may be extreme, but it shows just how crucial the three QRC pillars are. They must all and always be taken into account when developing any software product. Ignore one of them, and the product as a whole will suffer or be ruined for good.There are always fires to put out, quick features to implement, C-level executives asking for something to be done quickly, budgeting cuts, low development resources, etc etc. They cannot, however, prevent you as a product owner, developer, provider from following the QRC system. Every feature, every bug fix, and every user story or case should be sieved through QRC first, starting from the requirement solicitation phase. If, at times, you are forced to cut corners on one of the three pillars, do so knowingly, so that you can come back at a later time when things cool down. Fix and patch. Donâ€™t let features that havenâ€™t gone through the QRC check run rampant through your product.Note: It is possible to add more pillars to QRC to better fit your use case or to emphasize an ideology for your product/company as a whole. Most likely, however, any extension to QRC will fall under one of the systemâ€™s pillars and create redundancy.----Tech exec & entrepreneur, experienced in product development at Fortune & Global 500 companies, federal/local government organizations, and startups.Junis Alico--Junis AlicoinThe Startup--Junis AlicoinThe Startup--Junis Alico--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Tobias Charles--29Alex Mathers--220Bart KrawczykinProduct Coalition--9VinitainBetter Programming--29PaweÅ‚ Huryn--4HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

As the company continues to double down on original content and fend off competition from the likes of Hulu, Amazon, YouTube and Disney+, the rate hikes, the biggest since launching its streaming service 12 years ago, are a sign that getting â€œlocked inâ€ to a service, regardless of the price tag, can be detrimental to the consumers in the long run.Ecosystem lock-in has long been the classic strategy adopted by companies to retain users within their platforms. Whether be it by offering their services for free, or by undercutting rivals by offering them at a lower price, tech companies in particular have laid a groundwork where choosing a platform is tantamount to pledging allegiance to a singleâ€™s companyâ€™s products. Itâ€™s convenient, but at what cost?This lock-in is intentional by design: not only does it encourage customer loyalty (willingly or otherwise, because they have no choice but to), the energy barrier for a consumer to switch to a competitor is so high that it gives each company room to manoeuvre and gain market share. There is a reason why they are called â€œwalled gardens.â€The interesting thing here is that Netflix didnâ€™t start off as one. Originally launched as a DVD rental service, it astutely shifted gears to online streaming, but not before realising that the key to media dominance was a vast library of original content. The tectonic shift in recent years has led to it cutting back on licensing third-party content (which can be expensive) in favour of producing its own original shows.The result? A walled garden with a huge catalog of exclusive titles not available elsewhere and a steadily shrinking movie library (the streaming giant has removed more than 2,700 movies over the period 2010 to 2018), but also an increased potential to bring in a greater number of subscribers over time.While there is no doubt that replacing cable TVâ€™s walled gardens with newer, different walled gardens has led to fractured content availability, confusing subscribers (why is Bird Box only on Netflix, or Game of Thrones an HBO exclusive?), even the threat of driving frustrated customers back to piracy hasnâ€™t had a negative impact. Why? Once companies grow big, itâ€™s that much more difficult for their market share to shrink, and every time they differentiate, they tend to grab a few more people along the way.By effectively hooking users to their â€œwalled gardensâ€, the monopolisation has not only given them room to experiment â€” removing titles as they see fit (Netflix employs data mining to discern viewing patterns) or jacking up prices â€” they can do so with little or no cost to their bottom lines. Amazon, for instance, raised the price of its Prime subscription service from $99 to $119 last May, and the rate increase had surprisingly little effect on its paying customers, who were more than happy to shell out the extra $20 out of their pockets for the convenience the service offered them.In fact, a recent report published by Waterstone Management Group, a Chicago-based management consulting firm, found that 84 percent of Americans underestimate how much they spend on subscription services each month, indicating how most users are either blissfully unaware or donâ€™t even care too much to begin with, thereby making subscriptions a lucrative business model for companies like Netflix, Amazon and others.So yes, subscriptions are the way to go, but with the inevitable crowding of the streaming market, itâ€™s hard not to envision a future where users have to pay for countless streaming services if they actually want to access all of their favourite TV shows and movies. With Walt Disneyâ€™s Disney+ set to launch later this year (Disney is also an investor in Hulu), and Apple readying to unveil its own, the streaming landscape is all set to become the new battleground. Netflixâ€™s efforts, when viewed in this context, are nothing if not strategic and part of a larger ploy to lock in its users before they jump ship to rivals.----Computational journalist and cybersecurity reporterRavie Lakshmanan--1Ravie Lakshmanan--1Ravie Lakshmanan--1Ravie Lakshmanan--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

With over 300 speakers presenting more than 150 talks and several workshops across the two days, thereâ€™s far too much for me to cover everything I learnt. So, hereâ€™s just a few highlights from some of my favourite key talks...This was a really interesting session, where a group of us shared our thoughts and experiences on what causes women to turn away from tech roles, what can be done to combat the attrition rate of women in this sector and what other organisations are doing.Some interesting themes emerged from this discussion â€” some obvious ones, such as lack of recognition, lower salaries, poor maternity pay and lack of support when returning to work etc. However, there were a couple of less obvious themes:So, what can be done about it?Looking beyond the typical answers of examining maternity leave policies and reviewing salaries, when we begin digging into some of the cultural aspects, some members of group shared their success in using â€˜reverse mentoringâ€™. This is where younger women in the organisation mentor males in senior positions for a mutual benefit â€” the males can benefit from a fresh perspective, whereas the females have an opportunity to develop skills such as speaking with confidence.Asif Sadiq MBE (Head of Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging at The Telegraph) delivered a fascinating talk on the perception of D&I quotas in businesses. He covered a lot of ground, which I will attempt to summarise now (wish me luck).â€œDiversity and Inclusion is a business imperative, not a â€œnice-to-haveâ€. Itâ€™s needed to remain competitive in an ever-changing consumer landscape that is more and more diverse and businesses need to reflect and represent their customer bases to remain relevant. Inclusion is not a policy or a network, bring it out of HR â€” inclusion should be felt across the business.â€ â€” Asif Sadiq MBEAmy Freelander (Senior Product Tech Manager at Google) did a particularly brilliant talk. Hereâ€™s a very loose overview of her top 10 things to do to advance your tech career:â€œTechies arenâ€™t just all about maths and numbers and data, they are creative. They like tech because they like to create, to make something from nothing, to bring value and to be challenged.â€ â€” Amy FreelanderWith a predicted increase in human and machine integrated teams within the next five years, the future workplace needs to adapt, as do the skills required. The tricky part is that we donâ€™t what skills are, as the jobs of the future donâ€™t exist yet! Schools need to teach children how to learn, focusing on key elements of critical thinking, logic, emotional intelligence to prepare them for the future workplace.Businesses of the future will be software defined, effectively using R&D to continue driving forward and using AI to pre-empt demands. Tech is changing rapidly, so in this talk Dayne Turbitt, Senior Vice President of Dell highlighted the key emerging tech for businesses to monitor and adopt to stay relevant: collaborative AI/machine learning, 5G, internet of things, robotics, autonomous vehicles and blockchain.However, whilst getting excited about all this fabulous new tech, the key thing to remember is this: all this technology is irrelevant without humans!The recruitment pipeline needs to be expanded to include underrepresented groups. Bring people back in after career breaks and restructure training to upskill your talent. Adapt to GenZ â€” these new workers operate under entirely new paradigms: diversity is a given. They are more familiar with tech than any generation before them and are professional multi-taskers â€” capture their energy! Consider implementing reverse mentoring, having junior employees mentor seniors for mutual benefit.Among everything else, my biggest takeaway from this yearâ€™s conference was the sheer number of powerful role models I gained from it. Karren Brady CBE, Dr Rebecca Pope, Jo Hannaford... Badass women who are out there tackling big challenges both technically and socially and doing so in a way that they remain true to themselves. They donâ€™t compromise who they are to make waves, they embrace what makes them unique and apply that. They look to make changes both within themselves and in the world around them.

This concept of development was introduced by Kent Beck.While conventional programming practice, often follows this hierarchy,this process often becomes too long, and also requires high maintenance costs. Why? In this conventional flow, an engineer/developer often focuses more on implementing the code. This however leads to more focus on the programming aspect, often forgetting application requirement in the development process. In addition, the testing phase of the application in this model often consumes a lot of time, as only after implementation does one write and execute tests. Failure of tests in the final phase often requires more time to identify and fix bugs, as code dependencies grow tremendously and identifying regression issues becomes complex.This is what Test Driven Development(TDD) hierarchy looks like:Contrary to conventional development, in TDD a developer starts out by writing unit tests. These tests are precise checks that validates a particular feature of an application. This test is created keeping in mind the design and functionality of the particular feature, one is trying to implement. Itâ€™s a good practice for a team member other than the developer working on the feature to write these tests (QA engineer or Other team members). Once you complete the Test/Design phase, start out implementing the actual code. How do you write the code? In TDD, you write as minimum code as possible to pass the test case, then recursively improve on the code until the code is production ready.Since you now have a basic understanding of TDD, letâ€™s dive deeper into the actual phases of TDD and the reasoning behind every phase.TDD has three phasesIn the Red phase, you write a test case, for your requirement, that fails. Yes it fails, because you donâ€™t have the required implementation code to give the desired output. Here, having compilation errors while writing tests is accepted as a standard practice. In fact, you shouldnâ€™t write any implementation code in this phase (this includes dummy classes and function skeleton too).Having these questions in mind is a good way to write Unit Tests for your application in the Red phase.Once you have your first test case down, run it and ensure that it fails. A failing test case indicates that an application must meet the criteria to pass the test case. It also ensures that the test case isnâ€™t faulty.In the green phase, you write the actual implementation of the code. You write only the minimum possible code to ensure that the test case passes. In this phase, you can put aside your coding conventions, and hammer at your keys till you pass the criteria. Donâ€™t write code exceeding the criteria, as it violates that values of TDD (in reality you do have some room for flexibility here).Once your implementation is complete, then itâ€™s time for the refactor phase. In this phase, you write production ready code. Ensure you follow every convention you can to make your code fluent and melodic as a poem. Some common coding conventions to follow are as follows (SOLID, DRY, Design Patterns). At the end of refactor phase, rerun the tests to ensure that they arenâ€™t failing. If the test cases are failing, refactor your code again and rerun tests.Few important points to consider while writing code in TDD:What are the advantages of TDD?A well Documented Code:By having conscise test cases for your application, you can understand core functionality of the application by looking through your unit tests.Agile Code base:By having, unit tests for your code, you will be notified immediately when a functionality breaks. Unit tests can be run by developers and also by CICD environments, which ensures that code breaks and regression issues are identified immediately. This reduces maintenance cost for companies as bugs are identified quickly and fixed.Simpler and quality code:By ensuring that your write tests first, you are informed about the requirement before writing the actual implementation. By following this approach you ensure that you write code that does nothing more than pass the test case. Result of this is a concise code that adheres to quality checks.Do checkout Wikipedia for other relevant information on TDD.If you want a code walk-through on TDD then do check the link below.

Conversely, agriculture is highly polluting, and is attributed to 14% of GHG emissions each year. Population increases and consumer desires for higher meat content diets are putting forests under pressure as the land gives way to farming. This not only reduces the overall carbon sequestration effect of trees byreplacing it with agricultural land, but releases stored carbon as felled wood is burned or decomposes. The following three ideas describe blockchain applications across natural land use, exploring how the technology can enable an increase in the protection of natural ecosystems and more productive farming techniques that would reduce overall agricultural land area requirements and reduce the burden on forested areas.Use case 1: Nitrogen credit tradingTime horizon: Short termNitrogen oxide is a GHG 300 times more potent than CO2. Nitrogen-based fertilisers are widespread in agriculture across the world, and although the majority is absorbed by soil and plants a fraction oxidises. Blockchain technology could be used to enable a decentralised nitrogen-credit trading platform, similar to that described for carbon and cement in the electricity and industry sections of this series. I wonâ€™t delve into the detail in this section, however a credit system could incentivise farmers to reduce their consumption of nitrogen-based fertilisers, thereby reducing the release of nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere.Use case 2: Shared ownership of precision farming equipmentTime horizon: Medium termOne of the ways to reduce the land required by agriculture, and as a result its climate impact, is to increase the productive capacity of land already in use. Current farming practices tend to be generalised and not adapted to the requirements of the land on a microscale, resulting in unsustainable methods and sub-optimal yield realistation. Precision farming equipment that could enable small scale practice optimisation, such as UAVs enabled with hyperspectral cameras to enable precision weeding and targeted pesticide / fertiiliser application, is expensive. A blockchain platform could enable autonomous management of fractionally owned precision farming equipment, reducing the cost barriers to farmers to purchase and operate this equipment and resulting in an increase in its uptake. The resultant output increase of current agricultural land through the use of such equipment would likely reduce the need for land expansion and the resultant carbon cost as discussed in the sectionâ€™s introduction.Use case 3: Crowdfunded land conservationTime horizon: Medium termIndividuals are often looking for ways to reduce their personal contribution to climate change, however a method such as land conservation is often unattainable due to the high cost and administrative barrier of land purchase. A blockchain ledger and tokenisation of regions could enable large areas of land to be transparently crowdfunded with minimal friction. This would enable everyday consumers, who may not be as wealthy as Yvon Chouinard, to buy up fractions of land for conservation to protect the carbon sequestered there. For example, peat bogs are the largest source of sequestered carbon on earth but are generally only profitable to their owners if sold as fuel, resulting in a release of this carbon into the atmosphere. By enabling the crowdfunding of peat bog ownership, land owners can realise value through crowd sales whilst also enabling climate conscious consumers to directly contribute to conservation.Of course this would not stop other actors from buying swathes of land which could then be deforested or exploited by other means, but reducing the cost barrier of purchase may lead to a net overall increase in conservation by opening up the market to individual altruistic consumers.ConclusionNatural land use and its impact on climate change varies massively from contribution to prevention. High cost is a major barrier to enabling more efficient agricultural techniques or improving the accessibility of land conservation efforts to the mass population; two areas that can enable a higher proportion of natural land to be dedicated to GHG emission prevention. DLT can enable shared ownership of costly assets, whether precision farming equipment or of land itself, to enable more people to drive the climate change-reducing the benefits from such technologies or conservation schemes. In addition, blockchain can be applied to a nitrogen credit market to incentivise the reduction in usage of nitrogen-based fertilisers and the unintended consequence of nitrogen oxide-release into the atmosphere.Use the links below to navigate to the other sections of the series:Introduction â€” 5 min readPart 1: Electricity generation and provision â€” 5 min readPart 2: Transport â€” 5 min readPart 3: Buildings and cities â€” 4 min readPart 4: Industry â€” 5 min readPart 5: Natural land use â€” 4 min readConclusions â€” 2 min read----Sharing my take on things that I find interesting and important.Michael Yorke--1Michael YorkeinLevel Up Coding--1Michael Yorke--1Michael YorkeinBootcamp--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Jon CrabbinCoinmonks--22HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Yet the trend is clear: thousands of people are reckless and eager to use it.To me, having lived through the meteoric rise of the web, the parallels between the internet and Bitcoin are obvious. Both are networks, both are exponential technologies, and both enable new possibilities, new industries, new ways of life. Just like electricity was the best metaphor to understand where the internet is heading, the internet might be the best metaphor to understand where bitcoin is heading. Or, in the words of Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin is The Internet of Money. These metaphors are a great reminder that while history doesnâ€™t repeat itself, it often rhymes.Exponential technologies are hard to grasp and often underestimated.

Some may heard of it, some may not. But most are familiar with Bitcoin. To make clear, blockchain and Bitcoin are not the same, but itâ€™s often used in the same context. In this blog Iâ€™ll want to give you an overview of this whole topic and want to explain the blockchain technology. There are going to follow more blogs of this kind, because there is much to talk about and itâ€™s a current hot field in technology.So what is blockchain? Before I can answer this to you, you have to understand first off, how the internet works today. Letâ€™s pick Facebook as an example. On Facebook we can send messages, write comments, post things and can do so much more activities. Somewhere all these information have to be stored. Facebook itself is handling that for us. They are saving all those things on their servers. So Facebook is a service and people, who use Facebook, are the clients.Now if Facebook has some trouble with their servers, the clients might not be able to access Facebook, until the servers are fixed again. Also Facebook is able to see all the information people send to each other, because they are stored on their servers.So Facebook is in control of this whole network.The same is true for Google, Instagram and most of the services on the internet. But also for banks. We give them our money and the bank is managing it. In the case of a bad bank, we might lose our money, so we have to rely on them. And thatâ€™s the thing all those services have in common. Like I said, they have full control about the system and we as clients depend on them. These services are centralized and we have to trust them in some way.Now I want to illustrate the difference between centralized and decentralized systems on the basis of a banking system. Letâ€™s consider having person A and person B and both have a bank account. A wants to send B 100â‚¬. In order to transfer the money to B, the bank has to confirm and validate the transaction by storing it on the database of the bank. So the bank is the middleman and without the bank we wouldnâ€™t be able to transfer money in a digital formâ€¦. actually we can.Letâ€™s try to build a system without the bank in the middle. Because we have no bank account any longer, we have to save our money in a different way. We could store the money in a file on a computer by putting in the number of the amount we own. This t ime we have person A, B and C and they all own a file with their money on their computer. They can transfer money b etween each other.This is already a decentralized network, because their is no middleman and each person is independent in this network. What I mean is that, in the the centralized system, we arenâ€™t actually in control of our money, but in the decentralized case we are in control as long as our computer works.Now A sends B 100â‚¬ again.But no one confirms this transaction, so A still has these 100â‚¬ and could send it to person C. This is called the double-spending problem. How can we make sure, that A actually spent the money and canâ€™t send it more than once? Thatâ€™s the point, where blockchain comes into play.In simple terms a blockchain is an immutable linked list. Or differently said, combining blocks of data, so that you get a chain of blocks. Okay maybe, that didnâ€™t really help. Actually blockchain is in itâ€™s core a simple concept and I try to explain it as easy as possible.Like I said, the blockchain consists of blocks. These blocks contain information like a timestamp or transactions, if we use the blockchain for money transferring.Now this is a block. It contains the index showing the block number, a timestamp, when it was created, and a data field. In our case we put the transactions into the data field. At last we have the hash. What is a hash and what does the number 0xf61e21j9 stand for?A hash is created by a hash function. You simply put something inside the function and generate a number out of it and that is the hash. By putting in the same data over and over again you always get the same hash. By manipulating the data just slightly, you will get a completely different hash. You will see later, why this is very useful. If you get your hash you canâ€™t reverse the process and extract the input data out of the hash. So itâ€™s a one way function and itâ€™s like a fingerprint. Letâ€™s say we use the hash function h(x) for our blockchain. Now what we do is, we put in the index, the timestamp and the data field as the argument for h.That is how we generate the hash for the Block 1. In a moment you will understand, why we need the hash. We see, we have one transaction in our block. A wants to send B 100â‚¬. But what is, if B wants to send something to C or someone else wants to make a transaction. We canâ€™t just add those transactions into the Block 0 , because how I said, the blocks are immutable. There is no way to add or remove something from the block.So what we do is, we create a new block, where we can put the next transactions. If we have again new transactions, we create another block. This process goes on and on.Now we added two more blocks. Those two blocks have a new property prevHash. This one means previous hash and shows the hash of the block before. So in our case:prevHash of Block 1 = hash of Block 0and prevHash of Block 2 = hash of Block 1Block 0 doesnâ€™t have a previous hash, because this is the first block we have created and it is also called the genesis block.The blocks are linked together now, since the previous hash references to the previous block.Letâ€™s assume C is a hacker and he wants to manipulate the transaction (B â†’ C, 50 â‚¬) of Block 2 and replaces 50â‚¬ by 75.000â‚¬.  Remember, changing the data of the block also changes the hash of the block.The result is, that the previous hash of Block 2 doesnâ€™t match to the hash of Block 1. So Block 2 breaks the link to Block 1 and our blockchain becomes invalid. The hacker would need to change all blockâ€™s hashes to make the chain valid again, but that is almost impossible, if we have thousands of blocks. Thatâ€™s it for the basics of blockchain. To actually use the blockchain in a decentralized network, we have to concern some things and add mining and a consensus protocol. You can find that in my next blog.----Computer science student @ LMU MunichAlessandro Konrad--Alessandro Konrad----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Jayden LevittinLevel Up Coding--38Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Jon CrabbinCoinmonks--22HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

She expressed her appreciation on reading my article about 6 types of people in computer science and showed her interest to further converse to see how FOSSMEC might be able to develop the student community at KiTE.This was the first time my work was being recognized by an establishment and it truly felt fulfilling.I spoke with Sarojini Madam the following day and explained to her how FOSS culture developed in Kerala and its positive impacts. She expressed her interest to prepare a document based on the points I shared with her, which she later request me to mail as well.I felt it was important to explain the concept of FOSS and Open Source so sent a mail to explain the same.After discussing with the CEO and MD, she invited us to interact with their students. At first I was reluctant as I felt I was not the right person to introduce them as it would be hypocrisy (I did not contribute to the open source at that point). However, I proposed the following plan in collaboration with a few of my peers.We received thumbs up for this plan and so proceed with the necessary preparatory steps.

Joel V Zachariah (CS7A)We invited Subin Siby from Vidya Institute of Science and Technology to interact as well as he has commendable amount of experience in free and open source projects. A detailed report of the session (with supporting images) is provided below:The session began by 9 AM. Dr. Ashok, the MD of the establishment, felicitated the students who performed well in the 100DaysOfCode Challenge that they organized to encourage students to develop their programming skills. Dr. Ashok introduced us to the gathering as well.Sir explained why the institution is taking extensive steps to empower the students and why they should ensure that they maximize these chances.We encouraged students to ask questions and interact with the resources we brought to help them understand potential of open source.The session began by 10.30 AM with my talk on the 6 types of people in computer science and how students can develop their skills by climbing up this ladder. Next, Subin Siby introduced FOSS to the gathering by explaining the importance of digital freedom and open source in todayâ€™s world.After the lunch break, Anusree introduced the female students to the opportunities available for women in the field of technology and how it is important that they maximize those chances. Bharat took a session explaining why those who love solving problems should try competitive programming and develop their programming results as a result.Devdutt spoke about research scope in FOSS and how the students can leverage open source tools to improve their growth potential in the field. The sessions concluded by 2.30 PM and FOSSMEC agreed to extend its support to develop the Open Source Club of KiTE.I am grateful for this opportunity and hope to keep encouraging students, in collaboration with like minded peers, to improve in the time to come.----Uncovering value in testing times | joelvzach.co | Reach me at howdy@joelvzach.coJoel V Zachariah--Joel V ZachariahinMyTake--1Joel V ZachariahinyesFOSS--8Joel V Zachariah--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

These models are generally considered to be complex systems and difficult to analyze theoretically. Also, since itâ€™s usually a high-dimensional non-convex loss surface which governs the optimization process, it is very challenging to describe the gradient-based dynamics of these models during training. A new Google Brain paper shows that characterizing these gradient-based dynamics can be relatively easy while the learning dynamics of wide neural networks are under gradient descent.â€œIn this work, we show that for wide neural networks the learning dynamics simplify considerably and that, in the infinite width limit, they are governed by a linear model obtained from the first-order Taylor expansion of the network around its initial parameters. Furthermore, mirroring the correspondence between wide Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes, gradient-based training of wide neural networks with a squared loss produces test set predictions drawn from a Gaussian process with a particular compositional kernel. While these theoretical results are only exact in the infinite width limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the predictions of the original network and those of the linearized version even for finite practically-sized networks. This agreement is robust across different architectures, optimization methods, and loss functionsâ€. (arXiv).Synced invited Yi Wu, a 5th year PhD candidate at UC Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Stuart Russell, to share his thoughts on Wide Neural Networks.How would you describe Wide Neural Networks?â€œWide neural networksâ€ is a general term referring to those neural networks with large number of hidden units per layer as opposed to â€œdeep neural networksâ€, which typically have a lot of layers, but the number of parameter in each layer is small.Why does this research matter?First, why does this work in particular matter? It matters because despite the huge successes of applying neural networks to a variety of applications, it is still extremely important to understand why and how the neural network works. Such a fundamental problem does not only have scientific value to the whole scientific community but also could potentially provide insights for the development of new algorithms and architectures. This work is a nice step towards this direction of understanding neural networks, so it matters to the community.Secondly, why do Wide Neural Networks matter? This is because directly analysing state-of-the-art giant neural networks is hard, so we must start from some simplifications â€” wide neural networks is a necessary step before we can thoroughly analyze deep neural networks and finally reach the goal of fully (and theoretically) understanding general deep learning.What impact might this research bring to the AI community?On a high-level, this paper provides a very nice summarization and introduction of recent advances on the theoretical understanding of wide neural networks, including Jacot et al., Du et al., Allen-Zhu et al. Moreover, this paper presents very comprehensive experimental studies on real data and neural networks, which justifies the theoretical results. For the general community, this paper provides clear insights and can be viewed as a nice tutorial on recent advances on understanding deep learning. For the learning community, the positive experiment results can verify all the efforts and progress in this field as well as push the frontier of theoretical analysis of neural networks.Can you identify any bottlenecks in the research?Although the theoretical analysis is very clear and thorough, the main contribution and novelty of this work is the experimental study. The theoretical part does not provide any new theorems while it looks more like a (very nice) summary. Regarding the experiments, although most of the results are positive, we can still notice that in figure 5&6, as there are more training iterations, a gap might appear between the real neural network and the theoretical prediction (solid line and dashed line). Moreover, it seems that the training is not yet converged on the multi-class classification experiment (figure 6, bottom-middle). One might suspect whether the gap might become large on multi-class setting during convergence. To narrow such a gap between theory and practice might be worth further studies in the future.Can you predict any potential future related to this research?Deep learning theory is a remarkably popular area in machine learning recently, initially from the study of two-layer neural networks (e.g., Yuandong Tian, Li et al., Ge et al.), to wide neural networks (see references above). Recently, there is even theoretical progress on recurrent neural networks (Allen-Zhu et al.) and deep Q networks (Jin et al.). Although there is still a gap between our current best theoretical analysis and our state-of-the-art deep learning models, I am confident that in the future we could eventually have a complete theoretical foundation for deep learning in practice.The paper Wide Neural Networks of Any Depth Evolve as Linear Models Under Gradient Descent is on arXiv.About Yi WuYi Wu is a 5th year PhD candidate at UC Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Stuart Russell.

Yet the trend is clear: thousands of people are reckless and eager to use it.To me, having lived through the meteoric rise of the web, the parallels between the internet and Bitcoin are obvious. Both are networks, both are exponential technologies, and both enable new possibilities, new industries, new ways of life. Just like electricity was the best metaphor to understand where the internet is heading, the internet might be the best metaphor to understand where bitcoin is heading. Or, in the words of Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin is The Internet of Money. These metaphors are a great reminder that while history doesnâ€™t repeat itself, it often rhymes.Exponential technologies are hard to grasp and often underestimated.

This is the reason why there is a growing demand for improving the products that provide users with certain opportunities. It is achieved through developing technologies and using new approaches. Not all developers can actually do it because in this case, they have to rewrite most of the project. However, it is worth knowing what technologies are used in the modern world, and be aware of their advantages and disadvantages, as well as be prepared that one day you will have to use them.A monolith, or the architecture of the server application, puts all participants in the same environment:During API implementation, interaction with databases, cache, and third-party APIs aimed at obtaining information, takes place. This situation resembles a company in which a single boss (a server) orders his subordinates (database, cache, external API) to perform specific actions. Where is the problem here, and why did the microservice architecture appear?The problem is that if the â€œbossâ€ turns out to be unskilful, stubborn, and short-sighted, it will be difficult for him to cope with the expansion of the company or an increasing load. If the â€œbossâ€ (server) has skillfully designed the architecture â€” the interaction with the â€œemployees,â€ then with the same company growth it will be easier for him to cope with the tasks, at least for some time. But when the situation reaches the turning point (when the customer wants the result asap, but it is impossible to do due to the fact that many modules of the project are involved), he makes a decision to divide his tasks among other â€œbossesâ€, so that each â€œbossâ€ (server) performs specific tasks.Microservices are essentially a loosely coupled and easily modifiable software module. The project created with the help of microservices has microservice architecture. This method of development became popular in the 2010s, at the same time with the rise of agile development and DevOps. It is used by many companies: Netflix, Twitter, Amazon, PayPal, Uber, and others.Now the â€œcompanyâ€ has a lot of â€œbossesâ€ who manage only their departments and communicate with others, if necessary.The obvious advantage of the MSA compared with the monolith is scalability. Since the project is divided into microservices, each microservice is scaled independently.Microservices are independent, so if some modules fail, the application will still work, which is not the case with the monolithic architecture.A microservice does not depend on the tech stack, so you can choose the technology following the task requirements.One of the main disadvantages of this architecture is the exchange of data between microservices.The question arises: what happens if one microservice sent data to another, and the latter hasnâ€™t been working for the past hour? Such problems are solved by using message queues, i.e., the microservice that sent the data checks the message queue. If this data is not in the queue, it means that another microservice received the data. If the data is still in the queue, it has to wait for another microservice to start working.I hope that by this point, you learned enough about the power of microservices to start using MSA.What does highload mean? It is hard to provide an exact definition of that because of simple reasons. Letâ€™s look at two cases:So we can say that the highload begins at the time when the hardware can not cope with the execution of operations. In this case, we offer the following solutions:The fastest and cheapest solution is to upgrade or buy new hardware. Other solutions require more time and money. However, they are more promising than the first solution. Every time problems appear you will have to buy new hardware. Instead, it is enough to create a proper project architecture and write good code. It will withstand any load and will be scalable.Highload and MSA are promising areas. But do not forget about the monolith architecture since it is going to be used along with the MSA for quite some time.With the constant development of technology and the growth of the number of users, it is necessary to find solutions that meet the usersâ€™ needs. Whether to use new technologies or the old ones is a personal decision of each team or developer. But hereâ€™s my advice: while using old technologies, keep an eye on the new ones. Perhaps you will change your mind or borrow some solutions from them.If you enjoyed reading about this and you are looking forward to the next articles, support this article with claps, write comments, and subscribe to us on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

There are comments about whether people will pay twice for content, having paid the BBC licence fee but I think thatâ€™s a red herring. It didnâ€™t stop people buying DVDs, etc.I think the big question for the UK is what happens with Sky. In the US, weâ€™ve got a few years of cable cutting going on and many people moving away from pay TV. So, the cost of those cable services is getting replaced by streaming services.We donâ€™t have any data to suggest that Sky is seeing similar issues. So on top of your Sky bill people need an appetite to add more streaming services. Maybe for Disney with all those movies you cannot see anywhere else. But maybe not for the BBC/ ITV programming, lots of which is fairly widely available across the Sky EPG.The other issue is that the BBC, ITV and C4, because of their reputation for great content, do lots of partnerships with American networks (and other countries) to make co-productions.Going forward, is that in jeopardy if BBC or ITV want them to have their second window be on Britbox? If the partners on Killing Eve want to go to Netflix, can Britbox compete? The war for talent and the inflation in talent cost is so high now that funding does depend on where the programme will be shown.Itâ€™s interesting that the NBC streaming service Peacock has announced that they may have an ad funded version. Iâ€™m convinced that weâ€™re going to see this happen more and more. Amazon has done it with IMDb TV ( soon to come to Europe). The logic of having an advertiser supported service (as a way of recruiting customers to subscribe but also monetizing this content) is compelling.Washington Post have got a good summary of the streaming services. And when you go down that list you wonder how many of those are going to get people paying up for them. Every month.How they handle Sports is unclear but GAFA seem more focused; we hear that Amazon Prime could end up with the UK La Liga rights â€” after they were taken back from ElevenSports who struggled to sell subscriptions.And a new report from our friends at Tubular suggests there is around $13bn being left on the video table because measurement isnâ€™t yet good enoughPrivacyApple keep upping the ante on Privacy â€” they have revamped the Privacy part of their website to be really clear on what they do to protect privacy. The section on search stands out;With the Smart Search field in Safari, you can type website names, web addresses, and search queries all in one place. Safari minimizes the amount of data sent to third-party search engines â€” for example, it wonâ€™t share cookies or your precise location, which may happen if you search by other means. Safari also offers the option to set DuckDuckGo as your default search engine, allowing you to search the web without being tracked.What it doesnâ€™t say is that if you follow the default setting, Google handles your search and youâ€™re on your own.The Washington Post has a good piece on how sites are fingerprinting you across the web, mentioning half-way through that they do it too. The New York Times ran a piece on how you are scored, with all the data that companies hold on you as part of their service. All of this looks creepy and no-one is making a case for the positives.AdExchanger has an interesting piece, posing a simple question that no one else will answer; What happens to programmatic advertising as cookies crumble away?Talking about the current and imminent effects of GDPR, California Privacy and the browser changes, we use the hashtag #AdtechPerfectStorm. And our Wily Coyote picture to show that people are running out of road with this. Yet the silence is deafening. Identity solutions will work across individuals sites and across Trade Desk, AppNexus and GAFA â€” but sharing them only works with a third party cookie.The winners are going to be those publishers able to aggregate valuable audiences in a suitable context. If you havenâ€™t read the paper on Why publishers are missing out on data-driven revenue from our friends at Permutive, you shouldDTCWeâ€™re fascinated by the role Shopify plays in the DTC environment. They now have a million customers and their investments seem destined to position themselves as an anti Amazon. The hunger to hold on to data and be integral to the success of their customers was demonstrated with their squabble with MailChimp,which resulted in MailChimp dropping out of the Shopify App Store. And now Shopify have their own email service which appears to be pretty good. Being fully integrated with the rest of Shopify, Shopify email gives merchants really strong capabilities to send event driven marketing campaigns and measure results.It is being given away for free for now to a limited number of retailers, but no concrete decision on pricing yet.One piece of data that might help Shopify is some new research showing that just 71% of the sample said they felt Amazon puts its own interests ahead of sellersâ€™ interests.In our experience most brands need a dual strategy â€” DTC with Shopify and a well organised presence on Amazon. Working out the timing and the relationship between the two is where success lies.As we approach Black Friday, this is a pretty fallow time for most ecommerce businesses.But the smart ones are tinkering with their site and their tactics and getting ready forthe big weekend. Some interesting tips in this piece about Shopify apps that may help and here about abandoned carts notifications and how to use messenger and SMS as part of your marketing.Wholesale seems almost a contradiction to DTC but there are interesting connections happening. We mentioned Ark last week and now a VC is talking up Faire which gets DTC brands distribution in hundreds of small stores.My talk at Adludio last week was focused on how DTC brands need to think about marketing and what channels merit testing. The continued improvements in Google Shopping Ads make them a prime candidate â€” and this is a good summary of why.ChinaAlways lots to learn from China and Ex Google chief Eric Schmidt this week talked about the need for the west to continue to cooperate with China around AI, as theyâ€™re making such good progressCloser to our interests this is a great example of image recognition from ecommerce site taobao. Rather than describe a contact lens holder just take a picture of it, and simple visual search shows you which ones to buy. Similar tech is available from Amazon and more but itâ€™s rarely that simple.One of the problems visiting China is that as a foreigner you donâ€™t have access to the payment systems that work for everything but now Alipay and Ant financial now allow travellers a 90 day e wallet, so they can actually participate in the Chinese economy, the same as local people. The parent company Alibaba reported good figures for Q3 â€” although the 40% growth was their lowest improvement for 2 years. The results were party credited to better shopper targeting â€” increasingly helping merchants target consumers based on their personal preferencesOne interesting development this week was that the Chinese authorities set a curfew for under 18 year olds playing video games. Youâ€™re allowed 90 minutes during the week â€” none after 10pm â€” and a bit more of the weekend â€” and every person has to register to prove their age. I wonder whether watching lots of TikTok videos will come under the same scrutiny.We are fascinated by the whole South Asian region, thereâ€™s lots going on and this new report from Google looks at the what they call 100 billion dollar tech economy across Southeast Asia. Swipe Up and Right has lots of interesting learning. Fascinating companies and the sheer size of these markets is something that we occasionally forgetDigital AdsA TikTok leaked sales doc shows a move towards cost per click ad pricing. A CNBC report looks at how Snap, Pinterest and Amazon are all biting the heels of the duopoly in Q3.A Fix friend from Beeswax talks about the five challenges facing mobile marketing. And a Fix friend at Google summarises four of the programmatic myths that still plague our space.He eloquently raises the point that programmatic can be used with smart creativePremium inventory and brand building.HardwareAs the Google acquisition of Fitbit was confirmed the importance of peripherals never been clearer. The new Apple Pro earpods have had a great reaction and so too have the Amazon Echo earbuds with Bose noise reduction.The latest Google Nest hub has the biggest screen so far and can now work with facial recognition â€” using local AI. And VC firm Loup have a good piece on Apples grander vision for wearables â€” estimating that 75m Earbuds have been sold to date.Hardware is interesting again because suddenly people are investing in it again. And the imminent 5g rollout is going to make a difference to this as well. We talked about 5g connected the other week at Kinetic and we emphasise how speed changed everything; What takes an hour now, will take a minute and what takes a minute now, will take a second. And what takes seconds now, will be instant.Ericsson are looking at what that means for devices and how that may change.Gig economy.One of the TV ads that Amazon runs at the moment, shows what a happy place it is working in their fulfilment centre. You can even book a tour to go and visit yourself. (This is the US version)We think people are working out that the people making all these deliveries, driving your Uber and bringing your Chicken Tikka Masala are actually under quite a lot of pressure.The new Ken Loach film addresses this and an open letter to the founder and CEO of instacart summarises this point really well pointing out some of the poor practices theyâ€™ve undertaken, (like others) like reducing the sharing of tips with delivery people, etc.And Om Malik echoes much of this in a good piece on whatâ€™s wrong with the gig economy, talking about his experience of a food delivery.When we talk with retailers one thing weâ€™ve stressed is that the main reason people go to stores isnâ€™t for products anymore; itâ€™s for the people (a thought we first heard from Best Buy)So as well as the impact of technology, the smartest thing to do is to go check out your competitors stores. Find the really good people that are working there â€” the ones with the big smile on their face and that are good with customers â€” and lure them away. Pay them a bit more than average and treat them well so you got better staff than everybody else has. Itâ€™s the winning strategy in retail.I think at some point these firms are going to work that out that you can make your drivers and delivery people happy and that improves the last 20 feet. Making the delivery a good interaction with your customers is a small investment that really pays off.Political AdsI have been arguing for a while that Facebook should stop running political ads and now Twitter have just done that. Interesting that the main complaints are from Russia and Trump. Facebook have been quick to say they wonâ€™t follow suit where Shery Sandberg says the revenue is not worth the controversy.The whole situation is complicated by the difference between here and the US, where political ads can be bought on TV so the bias is towards people who have big budgets. in the UK you canâ€™t buy political ads on TV, so that issue doesnâ€™t arise,Essentially this is not about free speech, but about paid speech.I think that running unchecked ads for politicians sours the environment for those brands that know how effective Facebook advertising can be. Do we want Facebook users to be trained that you canâ€™t trust the promoted messages you see on Facebook?I do think that Facebook will stop running ads before the 2020 election â€” but we may have the UK election as evidence that paid ads are a really bad idea.Quick Readsa16z VC Andrew Chen has another great piece on the X of Y startup ideas.

However most hacking, data loss or data theft happens at an internal level. Employees leaving the organization are major threat factors for company data. For this reason, the organization should always employ appropriate security measures that can mitigate threats and protect company data from unauthorized access or theft.Here are some key steps and protocols which organization should adopt to ensure that no data leaves with an employee who has resigned or left the organization.Disable Access to the Employeeâ€™s Mailbox before the End-of-DayWe would normally think that access to company emails would be disabled before the End-of-day of the employeeâ€™s last working day, but many companies do not have a standard process in place to systematically disable the email account of an employee who has left the organization. Many companies fail to block the email account even after several hours or days of an employeeâ€™s departure from the organization. Understandably, this happens more in scenarios where the employee has chosen to leave the company on his / her own.If an employee is about to leave a company, the average notice period provided by the organization would be around 2 months. During this time, email access of the employee has to be monitored by the IT team for any peculiar or questionable activity, including but not limited to, forwarding large quantity of files to personal email IDs outside the organizationâ€™s email network, or printing large quantities of files.Disabling email access has to be added in the checklist of exit formalitiesBottom Line: E-mail access of employees leaving the organization has to be disabled before EOD.Develop the culture of using Single sign-on access for multiple applications at onceUsing of single sign-on access is just as important as disabling email access to employees who leave the organization. Employees access several different applications other than the mailbox, every day. Understandably, revoking access to all of the applications that the employee has access to, could be much more challenging.When the IT department administrates a Single sign-on for various applications by using active directory or any other identity and access tools, then it would be easier to disable all application access for any employee.Bottom Line: Identity and Access Management (IDAM) has to be deployed, and all applications have to be integrated with the tool.Restriction of IT AccessWhenever an employee leaves the organization with a 2 month notice period, the employee in question should not be allowed access to any critical application or data. If access is granted, it should be closely monitored, with need-base approvals by the manager, in order to avoid any data loss. According to Osterman Research, â€œ60 Percent of the employee may steal the data during the notice period especially on last working day.â€Bottom Line: RBAC (Role base Access control) mechanism has to be implemented, and any access to data needs the data ownerâ€™s express approval.Implementing Security Monitoring Software for prevention of data lossEmployees leaving the organization may attempt to illegally procure sensitive or confidential data through USBs, or through cloud management applications, such as box.com or Google Drive. For preventing such data loss, the organization would need Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Software. The DLP Software would alert any illegal activity through email to security professionals globally; logging is also available for security audit purposes. Alerts can be configured when employee copies the data to USB, forwards content to any external mail ID, etc. Once an employee breaches data security, through malicious or illegal activities, the organizationâ€™s legal team has the right to liaise with the HR and Information Security teams to take necessary actions, against the employee in question.Bottom Line: A DLP has to be implemented, and has to be monitored by the ISO (Information Security Officer).Proper Exit InterviewA proper Exit interview is the best way to educate an employee that is leaving the organization about any policies or agreement terms that the employee is subject to. During the exit interview, the employer has the opportunity and a duty to educate and or remind the employee about any policy or agreement terms, and to get proper and due sign-off, so that they understand the obligations of & consequences if, the employee engages in unacceptable activities when leaving the company. During the exit interview, the employerâ€™s main responsibility is to make sure the employee understands that any data that is created in and for the organization, or patents not belonging to the individual, is by definition, the companyâ€™s intellectual property.Bottom Line: Exit interview has to be conducted by the HR as well as the Business unit that the employee belongs to, so that it would be a techno-functional interview for educating employees in both prospective uses.Following the above practices could potentially go a long way toward keeping the enterprise data/Assets safe.----Bahwan CyberTekBahwan CyberTek--Bahwan CyberTekinBahwan CyberTek--Bahwan CyberTekinBahwan CyberTek--Bahwan CyberTek--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--220Scott H.

In fact the concept of factory do not exist before the industrial revolution. Products are produced at home using available material and power source at the time, which was mainly from wood. However, in the year 1750s the traditional fuel has been depleted in Britain, thus forcing the people to find alternatives. The knowledge on the use of coal and steam enable certain members of the society to create a centralised manufacturing system with the source of energy shared among many mechanical machines. These finding forces the people to come and work from outside their home, thus creating changes in societal norm. The changes is replicated in the next wave of industrial revolution with the electricity and communication advancement. The subsequent changes is when mass production and electronics been adopted in the industry. Currently, industry is busy adapting themselves with AI and cyber-physical system.In each of the industrial revolution the affect on the society differs from different areas of the world. In Malaysia, or at the first industrial revolution are made from a loose alliance of sultanate, the first industrial revolution bring a shortage of labour as at the time the demands for tin which is found in abundance here were very high. Thus the owner of the mines at the time are forced to find labour from China which at the time due to internal conflicts are looking to find better lives.However, the owners due to inexperience and lack of management skills were unable to manage the labourers who bring along their culture which significantly different then the culture of the locals. The conflict among labourers who organized themselves in gangs and triad make the production of tin suffers and lives were lost. The English colonialist who have some experience in dealing with the Chinese labourers were brought in to advise the mine owners on how to control the labourers. The changes brought in by the advisor changes the societal norms of the society under the Malay Sultanate forever. The tin mining, processing and the many related businesses were being managed by the imported labourer and the local population are being encouraged to work in agriculture to produce food for the population.The effect for the Malay Sultanate for the industrial revolution do not come from the technological advances of the revolution but on the need to feed the industrial revolution in Britain at the time.Similar effect were observed for the second industrial revolution here as the soil here are found to be suitable for rubber plantation. Again the landowners found out that the local population are not suited to work in the plantation and again resort to import labourers from India this time. This create another segment of the population with distinct cultures that do not exist previously. The large tract of land required for rubber plantation also changes on the norm of the society who until then mainly populate the river banks and estuary.Again the industrial revolution for the Malay Sultanate was not due to the population technological advancement but as a producer of the raw material. At this stage the local population have become pluralistic due to the distinct division of the population. Therefore, the Malay sultan had lose the leadership of the society which due to the division has grow without the Sultan.The Malaysian government take advantage of the third industrial revolution to promote Malaysia as the manufacturing hub for the microchips that started the industrial revolution. Electronics manufacturing hubs established in Penang and Kuala Lumpur again changes the societal norm. The population were enticed to work in electronic factories, and has created mass migration of youths from all areas in Malaysia to the manufacturing hubs.Currently, in the fourth industrial revolution the direction is less clearer then before as unlike the previous revolution where products and goods are the central theme, the current industrial revolution focuses on increasing the efficiency of the current process and services.Malaysia which have survived three industrial revolution as raw material, goods and products producer suddenly at loss on what kind of changes need to done here to take advantage of the industrial revolution. Currently, as manufacturing hubs Malaysia is on the last legs with the use of imported cheap labour which cannot be sustained anymore.It is imperative that Malaysians to prepare themselves for another change in the societal norms as work in the factories will not be there anymore. Jobs can be found in creative and health sector that is the demand of the fourth industrial revolution.However, the skills required for these sectors require more time in education. The AI based products and services require workers that have better grasp of fundamental in various areas thus require more learning time to achieve the level required. As an example a computer science student will require at least another 8â€“10 subjects on-top of the current subject to be able to produce and maintain an AI based system. This easily translates into another 1â€“2 years of tertiary education before the graduate can join the workforce.----Analogue at birth, Digital by design, Everything in between most of the timeLocalScientist--LocalScientist--LocalScientist--LocalScientist--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Saying youâ€™re going to â€œtake on Facebookâ€ today will get a few background snickers at a pitch session and polite nods from angel investors who quietly move on. Most technology startups today try to solve communications problems by improving processes to reduce costs and provide new revenue opportunities in legacy industries. An area with lots of opportunity indeed, but not as interesting as whatâ€™s next.The next wave of opportunity for technology startups will be focused on privacy and management of ones data. And the recent issues with Jeff Bezos will be ringing true to many an investor.At the end of the day, for 90% of technology startups, all they are doing is streamlining the flow of information and transactions to bring them to as near a zero cost as possible. They monetize their tools through monthly subscription models to achieve the desired rate of MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenues) that gets investors excited about multiples on earnings and how such a tool can be sold into a bigger tech giantâ€™s ecosystem such as Google, Apple, Microsoft etc. Or maybe taken public.If we look at consumer discussions around data breaches and privacy and the battle Google and Apple are waging internally and externally with regard to privacy, we can take some flying guesses that the next wave of opportunities for tech companies will likely be tools, apps and services that focus on a) protection of personal and corporate privacy b) self-management of ones own data and c) private interactions with the web and finally, d) decentralised web technology.These four areas are ripe for the picking. Already DuckDuckGo has taken first position in the private search world with Qwant rapidly coming into second place. Then thereâ€™s tools like Graphite Docs and Blockstack and the rise of privacy browsers such as Brave Browser and the experimental Beaker Browser. Then thereâ€™s Tim Berners-Leeâ€™s project Inrupt with Solid.Some pundits call this Web 3.0, others the DWeb or Decentralized Web and that it will be much better than all that has gone before. Not to be too cynical, but letâ€™s wait and see. Social Media was going to bring democracy to dictatorships, instead it gave dictators even more control and the Arab Spring turned into a bitterly cold digital winter.The next wave of opportunities will be based around apps that return control of ones data and activities to the originator. Focus there and youâ€™ll find opportunity. I predict this to become the hottest area for VCâ€™s investing in technology by the end of 2019.----Digital / Cultural Anthropologist | Featured in Wired, National Geographic & Forbes | Celt | Explorer | Intensely CuriousGiles Crouch | Digital Anthropologist--26Giles Crouch | Digital Anthropologist--12Giles Crouch | Digital Anthropologist--18Giles Crouch | Digital Anthropologist--2Fiona Renate--53The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Matt ChapmaninTowards Data Science--21Aaron Dinin, PhDinEntrepreneur's Handbook--8Henrique CentieiroinDataDrivenInvestor--3Scott H.

Humanity has reached a critical point in its development wherein the shadowy worlds of financial dealings, surveillance technology, the sex trade, the dark web, threat of mass destruction, the revolting perversion and corruption in the Church and the banking system, the capitalization of privacy acquired under the guise of public security measures and the potentialities of technocracy would need to be exposed, scrutinized, valuated and transformed accordingly.â€œâ€¦the movementâ€™s in motion with massive militant poetryâ€¦â€ -Rage Against the MachineThrough the passage of linear time there were occurrences of recurring themes, escalating in degree. They all happened within a 7 year period, every 84 years. Letâ€™s look at the segments based on the pattern:The common theme in the pattern involves churches or citadels being built or established, or their schism/collapse; horrific massacres taking place; the rise of legendary monsters from within humanityâ€™s ranks; spectacular explosions in space witnessed; creation of weapons of mass destruction; the banking system involved in scandal, death or chaos; progress made with printing and recording technology and this technology often becomes instrumental in causing revolutionary changes in crime detection as well as arousing concern in society about privacy; the study and implementation of radioactive power sources and thermal technology advances; disposable mass conveniences created; issues involving gender and sexuality become more radicalized; body alteration develops and biotechnology leaps forward.A generation are people who are born and grew up in roughly the same period of history. They share many characteristics. Their attitudes are formed by common experiences and exposure to a collective theme.Those born between 21 Nov 1974â€“16 Nov 1981* are â€œexplorersâ€. It is a group that is mostly intense, exuberant and somewhat disciplined. â€œMellow,â€ but also very cynical, relationships and sex are important to this generation (like other recent ones). Many children of the seventies and eighties feel the need to fill the cultural void in their lives by exploring the unknown and traveling widely***. They become aware of the stark differences with over-arching similarities in the human condition and the world at large.This is not a competition of generations. This is a call to mobilize those who are 38 to 44 in earth years. This age group was exposed to what was, aware of what is and possess foresight of what will be. To be in testimony of the successes and witness to the failures of their predecessors, they see the lurking danger of inaction to their future, so the best of them are driven to investigate the roots of our problems and bear the weight of correcting the mistakes or at the very least, do enough to set up a platform that the future generation can build upon. (Still, there are those who may act out their alienation destructively by numbing/distracting themselves or going about their lives with eyes wide shut whilst complaining of boredom or being afflicted with anxiety/depression).YOU. If you were born in the same generation as I am, we are presently in the position to alchemize resources and utilize all channels in order to initiate the unfolding of intricate lies, unveiling that which is hidden and calling out open secrets for what they really are.Standing at an apex, in the middle of the scale, our generation holds the power to influence the balance of human development potentialities.Supraliminal power is expressed using various media to convey a message through our profession, hobbies, creativity, and in whatever obvious manner we apply ourselves. Everyone can wield it.

116,30460,https://medium.com/@LotBlok/the-effect-of-autonomous-cars-on-the-automotive-industry-d0ea657451f?source=tag_archive---------160-----------------------,The Effect of Autonomous Cars on the Automotive Industry,None,LotBlok Inc.,https://medium.com/@LotBlok,4,55,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*FVzWaQ2EKKRY50YFSiIZUg.png","LotBlok Inc.Follow--ListenShareStarting on July 1st, Florida will allow autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the road without a human safety driver. In the future, automated systems will help avoid accidents, mitigate traffic congestion, reduce carbon emissions and more. Ultimately, riders will begin to worry less about driving their vehicle from point A to point B and more on ensuring that their vehicle brings them to the right destination.With companies like Tesla pushing this narrative to the main stage, the proliferation of autonomous vehicles is nothing to take lightly. The technological advancements are getting there, the statistics regarding rider safety are only getting better, and society is beginning to come around to the idea of having your vehicle drive you to your next destination. Better yet, the adoption of autonomous cars is expected to have a substantial net benefit on society.In theory, AVs will lead to safer roads, less traffic, and reduced parking. All said in done, itâ€™s projected that each autonomous vehicle will save nearly $2000 per year in social impact and may eventually approach nearly $4000 when comprehensive crash costs are accounted for.On the flip side, autonomous vehicles will begin to take the jobs of professional drivers across the globe. Whether itâ€™s trucking consumer goods across country to your everyday Uber driver, AVs will eat up the market as it becomes more and more cost efficient for companies to implement this technology.Now Iâ€™m sure many of you are wondering: Where does LotBlok fit in?Fortunately, we are largely aware of this narrative taking place. Self-driving vehicles will likely have seismic effects on the used car industry as society trends towards lower vehicle ownership.We expect that more and more people will look to sell their existing vehicle in favor of (1) leveraging cheaper ridesharing applications or (2) owning an autonomous vehicle as an investment product.As such, the cost of vehicle ownership will become more costly than simply having an Uber or Lyft app on your phone as car payments, insurance, repairs and fuel costs begin to turn drivers away. With all of this in mind, LotBlok is aiming to provide the liquidity for motorized vehicles as society trends towards newer, safer autonomous vehicles.The automobile industry has historically been slow to adopt new technologies. With this, car manufacturers have been reluctant to develop full-featured electric cars. As a result, technology-focused companies such as Tesla and Google have taken the lead on the road to innovation. If autonomous vehicles become prevalent, we forese technology-driven companies leading the charge with the potential to eat up the market share of existing car manufacturers such as Ford or General Motors.Furthermore, we could see the time of idle vehicles coming to an end. Owners of autonomous vehicles will be able to rent out their vehicle on Uber to pick up and drop off passengers while theyâ€™re busy at work or sleeping at night. With this, Uber rides will become increasingly cheaper as vehicles will ultimately shift towards becoming an income-producing asset for many early adopters.With all of this in mind, there will always be hobbyist looking to drive their vintage vehicles or gas-guzzling muscle cars. Driving will likely become a hobby for gear-heads who canâ€™t get enough of their 89â€™ Porsche Carrera or 94â€™ Chevy Truck. Unique vehicles will be highly sought out amongst individuals who still hold their passion, and rightfully so. This market will hopefully surge in the coming decade as electric vehicles take hold of the mainstream and we at LotBlok are excited to preserve this aspect of our culture and society.LotBlok is a technology-driven company and we have to prepare for the future. Our platform allows users to easily liquidate their existing vehicle for a great cash offer. As AVs become more commonplace in the mainstream, LotBlok plans to act as the primary aggregator for early adopters looking to upgrade the first generation of AVs to the newest technology. As a result, LotBlok will always strive to offer the best upstream inventory available on the market.As we continue to scale and offer vehicle liquidations to new areas across the United States and eventually the rest of the world, LotBlok is strategically placed to take on the influx of new volume in used vehicle sales that follow this next wave of innovation. Our previous partnerships with companies such as Tesla, Shift and Roadster have prepared us well for working with industry leaders and we donâ€™t expect this ethos to change anytime soon.If youâ€™re in California or Oregon and are looking to sell your vehicle in favor of an AV, weâ€™re ready to take your requests. Sign up and begin your vehicle liquidation process and get a cash offer within a few minutes.----Transportation LiquidationLotBlok Inc.--LotBlok Inc.--LotBlok Inc.--1LotBlok Inc.--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Aaron Dinin, PhDinEntrepreneur's Handbook--8HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

He found no quantifiable method to measure the blood loss from females that suffered antepartum haemorrhage (blood loss during pregnancy); a problem that needed resolving due to significant management modality variability with degrees of haemorrhage.After conducting a study, he found that doctors underestimated blood loss over more than 20% and nurses conversely overestimated blood loss by a similar figure. Inferring that females received suboptimal management at times.The junior doctorâ€™s solution? A really simple method: soak the blood loss onto an Inco or similar sheet and then weigh the sheet once blood soaked. The difference between the weight of the Inco sheet and weight with blood soaked in the Inco sheet was then the measure of the amount of blood loss.Finding this seemingly simple solution, a self-explanatory change was needed in this department. But how long did this change take to implement? Near 18 months. Yes 18 months!The necessity of rapid change:As the NHS and social care system are at breaking point with a probable Â£20 billion annual deficit by 2022/23 (1), the greatest challenge faced currently is a chronic shortage of workforce, with current figures stating a shortage of 43,000 nurses (2) and an overall workforce shortage of 110,000 in the NHS and social care (3).Latest projections from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that a timeframe of 50 years, there will be an additional 8.6 million people aged 65 years and over; which in perspective, is approximately the population of London (4).With a directly proportional relationship between life expectancy increasing and the amount of time spent in poor health, it seems a person with chronic comorbidities has more complex treatment needs comparatively to a person with a single condition. The Health Survey for England show that in 2016, 29% had 2 or more chronic conditions in the age group of 60 to 64 years. For those aged 75 years and over, this increased to almost half as seen in the figure below (4, 5).As healthcare requirements increase with age, healthcare costs increase steeply from around the age of 65 years.Why is rapid change not possible?Evidently, even though rapid change is required to ensure a sustainable NHS for future generations, the pace of change is not such speaking from experience.Then how can this change occur? A mantra I say is â€œchange is all about people, people and peopleâ€.The mind undergoes three distinct stages before one can effectively make a change. Morin breaks it down like this (6):1. Pre-contemplation: where you wonder whether you really need to change anything.2. Contemplation: where consideration of your options including thoughts like â€˜maybe I should make a changeâ€™ occur.3. Preparation: here, your mind shifts towards planning. â€˜How am I going to make this change.â€™When asking the NHS to change the delivery of technology or innovation, we need to be mindful of the phases which require the most time and energy.The ground reality is that we do not give the staff the adequate time to go through these phases. Only 28.7% of nurses felt there were enough staff at their organisation to do their job properly (7). Even at full capacity, staff are strained. A patient gets admitted within 1 hour and 15 minutes after discharging a patient, reinforcing the pressured time that staff have to refresh and deliver efficient patient care.Whilst these existing pressures remain, at what point do we expect staff to engage and successfully implement changes, even with them being as simple as soaking an Inco sheet with the blood from the floor and weighing it? To think about its significance? To think about how their processes might work? How it may improve their quality of workflow and patient care of pregnant females?With this being a fairly simple change, when considering paradigm shifts in patient care such as digital transformation, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and population health transformative technologies, it is crucial to empathise with staff and their efforts after understanding the difficulties that changes may come with.Catch 22Till we solve the workforce issues, it is possible that a full transformation of the NHS and social care systems may not occur for future generations. Albeit it is unsustainable to keep increasing staffing levels, an acute cut in the existing staffing gap is needed to enable transformation and allow a downward inflection point; allowing for a personalised healthcare system.When it goes rightThat being said, when you engage an organisation and give staff the time to understand the new process, you can achieve some fantastic results as seen with #PurgeThePager at West Suffolk Hospital.These happy faces are during and just post Go-live of Medic Bleep at West Suffolk Hospital. But having insight behind the work for change, it is acknowledged that the change has only begun as we need to support staff and guide them in the processes around technology, should they need it.About the AuthorI am passionate about remodelling health and social care; not just in the NHS, but globally. I believe that health/med tech will help enable and underpin this.Our work has been mentioned in Parliamentary Bill to #PurgeThePager put forward by Matt Hancock and our study to show each nurse and each junior doctor save 21 minutes and 48 minutes with Medic Bleep of which I am the Founder.I am also an Innovation Mentor for GP trainees and GPs at the Royal College for GPs alongside Faculty at Harvard Medical School for Postgraduate Teaching for Surgical Leadership and Innovation.Find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/drsandeepbansal/Thank you to Meenakshi Jhala for being a co-author:Meenakshi is a fourth-year medical student at St. Georgeâ€™s University of London, currently intercalating in Neuroscience and Psychiatry.

Use the ClickUp app for your iOS/ Android device, the desktop app, the web app â€“wherever you go, ClickUp is right there with you.Itâ€™s also great for storing information, like recipes, planning a birthday party or managing tasks or tracking contacts for networking. Here are some great ways you can use ClickUp in your life.ClickUp also helps you stay in sync, because you can use it across devices and even connect your Google calendar.Here are some key features you get for free when you use ClickUp as your personal productivity platform and to-do list app.Whatâ€™s up with ClickUp?Bottom line, it has the features youâ€™d love to have for your to-do list and task management, with the power to do more. Oh and all those great features? Absolutely free. Why not go for it? Use it as your primary task management app, project management tool or your basic to-do list app, all in one!On the pro version, you get more storage and more advanced features.Sign up here to start with ClickUp!Pros:Cons:Download: iOS | Android | WebPricing: Free to $5 per user/per monthTodoist was recently named the best to do list app by The Verge and itâ€™s easy to see why.The simple, elegant interface puts the focus on the tasks at hand. Just type in the action you need to do, set a due date and it will remind you of when your deadlines are quickly approaching.Todoist shows you tasks that are due today, tomorrow and within the next week. For apps that focus on simple reminders, itâ€™s great.I put in the items I wanted to research, and then the app prompted me to do them quickly. Iâ€™ve never tried to do a big project in Todoist, but I donâ€™t need it for that. I need it to tell me when to do follow-ups or to pick up laundry.Whatâ€™s nice though is that Todoist integrates with Google calendar, and so your tasks and events can meet up themselves. Thatâ€™s the hard part of most to-do mobile apps.It also works great for everyday tasks like sharing a grocery list with your significant other or splitting it up among roommates.Another nice perk?Todoist suggested projects for me to add to like shopping, personal or even movies I want to watch. Thatâ€™s a handy reminder that doesnâ€™t really need deadlines but is a convenient feature.Bonus:Todoist will show you the task history, so you can see what youâ€™ve finished and helps you set goals for each day to stay productive. You gain karma points when you complete tasks and projects which give you a little more incentive. It can also be translated into a basic task management app for your teams.Todoist Features:Pros:Cons:Currently using Todoist but want to try ClickUp? Import your tasks.Available: iOS | Android | WebPricing: Free to $5 per user/monthThis task management app has been around for a while, and itâ€™s still a solid choice. Its name kind of says it allâ€“itâ€™s a place to dump all of your random ideas into a central place. Like getting milk after work, or calling family members on their birthday. The simple stuff.Their smart list feature is really nice, which lets you write out the details and due dates in one line with natural language. It will also send you texts and Gmail notifications to customize how you want to receive information.Remember The Milk opts for simple tags and smart lists over the more formal â€œprojectsâ€ which I think is a good choice for a personal application like this. Sample tags include work, personal or â€œbananas.â€ In other words, you can make tags for anything.Free vs. Paid VersionRemember The Milk has made a lot of their essential features limited to the premium version, like subtasks or getting mobile notifications. You get many of those things for free in your usual task management tool. However,if you like the interface or are already in the Remember The Milk universe, then upgrading probably makes sense.Remember The Milk Features:Pros:Cons:Download: iOS | Android | WebPricing: Free to $39 per yearI asked a friend of mine the other day which to do list app he uses, and he mentioned Google Keep. This surprised me because I use Google Keep just as a note-taking app, not a personal to-do list software.However, it makes sense in many ways, especially if youâ€™ve been wedded to pen and paper for most of your life. Itâ€™s kind of the same, just with quicker formatting. You can title your list, save it and then come back to it later.You can also set reminders (I should do thisâ€¦) and come back to notes or other items later. Color-coded labels serve as â€œtagsâ€ in this scenario.This is good ifâ€¦youâ€™re enmeshed in the Google App Store or Android world. It fits in seamlessly with the collaboration tools youâ€™re probably already using to organize your life. Itâ€™s also a native part of every Android phone.Personally, I like the â€œpinnedâ€ posts option which keeps important to-do list items at the top of your mind.Google Keep Features:Pros:Cons:Download: iOS | Android | WebPricing: FreeThis to-do list app is new (neaux?) to me but it looks cool. Itâ€™s well-designed, with big, bold fonts but in a clean non-flowery way.Tasks are laid out in a weekly view, showing the highest priority tasks you need to do for each day of the week. Itâ€™s also simple to move tasks from calendars and lists and back again.Hereâ€™s the good part: If a task isnâ€™t done one day, it simply rolls to the next day. Thatâ€™s amazing and makes a whole lot of sense.You can quickly add in recurring tasksâ€“that way you donâ€™t have to rewrite the same thing every day or schedule it out every single day. Thatâ€™s nice, too.Something different? Teaux-Deaux bills itself as a â€œdesignâ€ app in the App Store, meaning they appeal to creative types. One way they do is by adding markdown features to their tasks. That means you can bold or underline if you need a little extra push.TeauxDeux Features:Pros:Cons:Download: iOS | WebPricing: $2/month or $24 annuallyThings takes a minimalist approach and gives you a lot of white space to add details for your projects or chores. You start with a big list and then add smaller elements underneath.This is like if youâ€™re scheduling a big eventâ€“like a vacationâ€“and need to do several things to prepare. As a task manager, this allows for more nesting and helps you separate into more categories. The advantage of headings is that you can move the whole set of tasks, mark them complete or change the due dates.You also get checklists, like if youâ€™re packing for a trip or need to make improvements.Hereâ€™s the thing: It also has a magic button, which isnâ€™t as glorious as it sounds, but is still a convenient way to add tasks, no matter which category they fall in. If you do use headings, Things has nice visual cues to show progressâ€“and how much work you have left.And itâ€™s only for Macs and iOS. They havenâ€™t designed mobile apps for Android devices.Pros:Cons:Download: iOS | WebPricing: $9.99 to $49.99Wunderlist is beautiful and it looks accessible. It has more visual cues than typical to-do list software in a contemporary format.Itâ€™s also easy to share a task list and responsibilities with your partner, family or co-workers to streamline your life. Their tagline is â€œkeep your life in sync.â€ Thatâ€™s a promise that anyone can get behind.Wunder what theyâ€™re up to? Wunderlist is slowly moving into the project management space, with assignments, file storage and even note-taking capabilities that make it a blend of Evernote, Google Keep with simplified project management.Also, Microsoft purchased Wunderlist and has made Microsoft To-Do (see below). That doesnâ€™t make too much sense, so donâ€™t get too invested with this one.Pros:Cons:Download: iOS | Android | WebPricing: FreeTickTick harnesses the power of traditional task management into an app-first interface.

And so, centralized control of infrastructure leads to a centralized political economy. It follows that decentralization and community control of the means of production could enable humans, individually and collectively, to create a culture of freedom â€” both from the burden of debt and through self-actualization, the pinnacle of Maslowâ€™s hierarchy of needs.(1)Individuals who find empowerment through self-sufficiency and resource autonomy become truly sovereign beings. Freedom of consciousness and the achievement of human potential is a natural consequence of autonomy and liberation from scarcity.The requisite knowledge to implement a decentralized political economy exists today; however, that knowledge is not distributed. Sharing knowledge â€” and rewarding its distribution â€” is a central need in the cash-poor and knowledge-rich twenty-first century.Centralized control of energy production has led to centuries of conflict in the Middle East, funding the rise of oppressive regimes across the region. Human rights and environmental abuses in the Amazon rainforest by Texaco have gone unchecked due to collusion with national governments.(2) And Royal Dutch Shell had a hand in the Nigerian governmentâ€™s execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. (3) These are just a few examples of the dangers of centralized control of energy production.In Japan, India, Pakistan, the USA and other nation-states, the presence of nuclear energy often coincides with the rise of the military-industrial complex and the justification of the surveillance state as guarding access to this powerful technology. Nuclear power has historically resulted in the externalization of costs from meltdowns, decommissions, and secure nuclear waste disposal onto taxpayers, who subsidize this energy source.The water industry, which many consider the â€œpetroleumâ€ or key global resource of the twenty-first century, is under similar attack. Consider the case study of Bolivia. The government of Bolivia accepted a $2.5 billion contract to hand over a municipal water system to a multinational corporation, which then attempted to prohibit citizens from harvesting and collecting rainwater from the sky, leading to severe civil unrest.(4) Meanwhile, in Mexico, Coca-Cola has been shown to exploit the water resources of indigenous communities.(5)With the centralization of food production, Monsanto-led industrial scale agriculture has led to a decline in genetic biodiversity and an existential threat to the global bee population.(6,7) Monocropping and the use of agricultural pesticides have been identified as key contributing factors. We find similar cases of government and industry exploitation of communities in mining, logging, and most other primary industries.The global economy in aggregate is becoming centralized in an unprecedented manner, concentrating power and money in the hands of a few players.(8) The very systems that sustain us, including finance, food, water, and energy, have been consolidated into monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels.In order to nurture an ecosystem based on true decentralization â€” to regenerate rather than extract pools of natural capital â€” we must design systems that incentivize circular flows of value in localized areas, while preventing leakage of value to centralized and extractive economic industries.True decentralization is difficult to imagine without local control of the means of production. This translates into local ownership, direct access, and ultimately control of underlying infrastructure. In the 1960â€™s, a coal economist working for the British government named EF Schumacher developed the concept of appropriate technology.Appropriate technology has minimal social and environmental negative effects, is relatively simple to understand and operate, and is cheap and easy to produce, ideally with locally-sourced materials. Appropriate technology has few dependencies on outside specialized knowledge and expensive imported materials. Therefore, it is resistant to centralization.After spending years recommending an increase in coal production to meet the growing needs of the British economy, Schumacher projected an unsustainable trend of continuous increase of coal production necessary to meet growing demand. This would have massive social, environmental, and political consequences.His prescription was to design human-centered technology to meet human needs while minimizing negative externalities. The majority of the technologies described below constitute appropriate technologies.An essential accompaniment to appropriate technology is the application of permaculture design science. Permaculture design is the design of a culture that can sustain life (and in our case human life) indefinitely. It generally constitutes circular systems that recycle resources, optimizing for â€œresource productivityâ€ and minimizing for waste. A related design field is biomimicry, which is design inspired by and imitating natural systems, which often are inherently zero-waste.A reimagined water system would entail a drastic reduction in the distance water travels from the source, to the point of consumption, to the point of disposal. It would also mean a focus on multiple â€œpost-consumerâ€ uses for water, such as redirecting shower water for irrigation.The first component of such a system is rainwater catchment and collection. Terraformation, and specifically swales on contour, can capture water and sink it into the ground using simple gravity. This maximizes the capture of rainfall over an area and reduces the need for irrigation, simultaneously replenishing the water table, wells, and springs.The Warka Water Tower technology, for instance, empowers African villages to harvest moisture from the atmosphere in sub-Saharan dry desert climates, where previously the only solution was often expensive bottled water from Coca-Cola or other multinational corporations.The next element is filtration. There are a number of low-cost solutions that provide filtration solutions at the household and municipal level. These include a number of natural filtration materials such as clay, stone, and activated carbon (charcoal), as well as UV sterilization systems. EcoFiltro is one social enterprise with an amazing track record of bringing clean water to remote villages in Guatemala and creating local â€œwater grids.â€ Liquid Life uses blockchain technology and existing cellular networks combined with novel water filtration technology to create an innovative distribution system in rural Africa.After primary uses for water such as drinking, cooking, and bathing, water can be â€œdown-cycledâ€ for secondary purposes such as irrigation. In the urban context, we can imagine apartment buildings channeling sink water and bathwater into urban garden systems.The final essential component is storage. Whether it be in retention ponds, cement tanks and cisterns, or directly in the soil, water â€œbankingâ€ is an essential component of water self-sufficiency. This element is particularly important in areas of the world where there is a wet season with months of rain followed by a dry season where rainfall is sparse or non-existent. The Incas were masters of this art and had massive storage tanks for water.The decentralization of the food supply in some ways marks a return to pre-industrial farming networks. A decentralized food system involves growing and sourcing locally, minimizing transport between production and consumption, and harvesting food waste to convert into compost and create the input for a new production cycle.These methods are still active in many areas of the world today. One example is southern Mexico, where the autonomous Zapatista communities of Chiapas and Oaxaca organize based on ancestral indigenous organic food production methods.Utilizing techniques such as permaculture design, agro-ecology, biodynamic farming, Masanobu Fukuokaâ€™s One Straw Farming Method, and selecting crops that are appropriately adapted to climate and season, we can design food systems to increase in yield and resilience with each year. Non-local, non-organic inputs can be greatly reduced utilizing these methods, decreasing economic as well as environmental costs.Using local heirloom seeds and plant stock is a fundamental element in all of the above strategies. Not only are these seeds more resilient, but they also allow the farmer to legally harvest and replant their own seeds, taking back control of their seed supply. This autonomy is often impossible with commercial seed purchased from multinational seed corporations, where the farmer needs to purchase seeds each year.Concerning transportation of food, the same principles apply as with water systems. Decreasing transport distances lowers both cost and carbon footprint â€” and increases freshness. It also decreases the need for sophisticated in-transport preservation and refrigeration systems that can involve harmful contaminants both for the natural environment and the human body.The final component of a decentralized food supply is the closing of the resource cycle â€” capturing outputs and converting them to inputs. This applies to water, plants gone to seed, eroded topsoil, non-edible components of a plant (which can often be turned into secondary products), and all the way down to food waste and kitchen scraps at the consumer level.A decentralized energy supply minimizes transmission time (and loss) between the source of production and the site of consumption. Distributed micro-grids powered by renewable energy are emerging around the world as a competitor to utility companies that rely on massive power plants and lengthy transmission distances.Before the Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown, 30% of Japanâ€™s supply was nuclear. Since Fukushima, the majority of plants remain closed and the government has been supporting a decentralized mix of new renewable energy sources. The Fukushima Renewable Energy Fund launched to help local communities create energy cooperatives and install solar panels and wind turbines.(9)Power Ledger, Pylon, and Swytch are three blockchain projects to watch, building critical components of the decentralized energy infrastructure. Blockchain networks connecting energy producers and consumers offer an alternative to participation in centralized energy systems; they create the right conditions for novel business models and incentive structures to emerge.On the consumer side, thereâ€™s a beautiful case of an emerging network of electric car owners who are opening their home charging stations (often powered by rooftop solar panels, and even rooftops made of solar panel tiles) to each other. Plugshare and ChargeHub are examples of the real sharing economy. As these networks grow, they are increasing the range an electric car owner can travel, while nearly eliminating fueling costs. We can envision this system eventually eclipsing the existing network of petrol stations and the vertically integrated international supply chain behind them.Throughout the centuries, cities have been built by sourcing local natural materials and employing climate-adapted building techniques optimized for comfortable living without external inputs.In the Southwestern desert of the United States, Navajo and Hopi structures are designed to keep the inside cool during the day, while capturing, storing, and radiating heat at night to keep the dwellers warm. Passive climate control techniques like these require knowledge of local materials as well as careful design.Designed with care and knowledge, buildings can minimize or entirely eliminate the need for heating, collect and store rainwater, and repurpose water from household uses for secondary agricultural uses. Amory Lovins, author of Natural Capitalism, has pioneered some of these methods. He founded a school, The Rocky Mountain Institute, where students can learn how to implement these techniques. CASSA in Guatemala is another social enterprise leading the way in designing affordable housing that eliminates or reduces utility bills for life. The earthships of Taos, New Mexico are a testament to what can be done with local materials and masterful design.In addition to local materials, we have access to a growing stream of industrial byproducts that can be repurposed for housing material. Hempcrete is a strong lightweight material consisting of compressed hemp fibers, and is an increasingly available and affordable byproduct of the cannabis industry.Beyond the design of an individual house, we can also consider the art of designing living spaces for small communities. Arcosanti is a unique experiment in optimizing the use of space for communal purposes, and is a prototype for what urban spaces could look like in the future.The 3D-printing revolution is giving consumers the ability to design and produce their own dwellings in a customizable manner with fewer and fewer barriers â€” and then share their designs with the global community. We can anticipate further innovation and diversification as the 21st century progresses.The means of production and the knowledge to operate those means of production are becoming more available to consumers by the day. Rapidly declining costs of 3D printers, combined with the rise of membership-based maker spaces and fabrication labs (â€œfab labsâ€) are leading to the democratization of production and open source hardware.The Open Source Ecology is a noble and ambitious attempt to prototype a set of machinery that could serve as the basis to create an entire civilization. Appropredia is a Wiki for appropriate technology models. Hackerspaces Wiki is a useful resource for finding hackerspaces and communities around the world.Economist Herman Daly wrote in Steady State Economics that todayâ€™s economy maximizes throughput of materials, and optimizes for programmed self destruction and planned obsolescence. Tomorrowâ€™s economy must maximize resource productivity (the amount of productivity that can be derived from a resource), durability, potential to recycle or down-cycle materials after primary use, and slowing throughput of materials through the economy.Daly posits that we must redefine â€œeconomic growthâ€ to signify growth in resource productivity and in the knowledge economy, and that we cannot indefinitely increase the amount of materials our economy consumes.(10) Through the employment of biomimicry (mimicking natural processes) and industrial ecology (designing production processes to mimic an ecosystem of synergistic outputs and inputs), we can redesign our production systems.An interesting living case study of a decentralized political economy is the network of autonomous indigenous communities across southern Mexico, concentrated in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. A number of these communities identify with the Zapatista movement, a modern post-Marxist political movement espousing bottom-up governance, direct democracy on the community level, and exit from centralized political and economic systems. Unsurprisingly, this movement has seen violent repression by its host nation-state.The indigenous zones of Chiapas and Oaxaca have historically been a difficult area for the Mexican nation-state to govern, as the stateâ€™s authority has never been fully recognized by the patchwork of indigenous tribes that populate the mountainous region. The population of these regions already contains a high degree of resource self-sufficiency and elaborate systems for managing local natural resources that date back thousands of years.The Zapatista movement is somewhat unique in that it fuses modern political theory with ancestral customs that pre-date the arrival of Europeans in the Americas. Intact village-scale governance systems are structured in such a way that â€œtaxesâ€ are non-monetary obligations of an individual village memberâ€™s time. Public services such as municipal administration, security, and waste collection are covered in this way, on a rotational basis. Barter systems are abundant; for example, one can pay school tuition with maize and other agricultural crops.In the bottom-up governance structure of Zapatista communities, representatives are elected by each community. These representatives congregate with each other to develop proposals which are then brought back to the communities. Each community can vote whether to accept or reject a certain proposal, retaining full autonomy at the community level. This system bears similarities to early 18th-century iterations of the United States of America, before power became concentrated in the executive branch.Switzerland also offers a number of informative case studies for a decentralized political economy. Some towns have managed a continuously unbroken commons governance protocol to manage communal farmland and forest across the centuries.(11)20th vs. 21st Century Technological TrendsIn Zero Marginal Cost Society, author Jeremy Rifkin compares 20th and 21st century technological trends. The conclusion is an optimistic prediction of the emergence of a decentralized society.First, letâ€™s look at the communication, energy and transportation matrix that enables the flow of information, electricity, raw and manufactured goods, and of course humans. The 20th century was characterized by â€œOne to Manyâ€ production and distribution systems, and favored business models that sought vertical integration and centralization. Telecommunications was dominated by television and radio, both â€œone to manyâ€ broadcasting technologies that favor large corporations and authoritarian political regimes. The energy industry saw the meteoric rise of fossil fuel production and nuclear power, accompanied by large centralized production facilities and the surveillance state necessarily guarding nuclear technology. Transportation was dominated by the internal combustion engine, road, and rail.The 21st century is characterized by the rise of â€œmany to manyâ€ technologies, peer-to-peer networks, and the sharing economy. Communication in the 21st century happens on the internet and cellular networks. We now have instant access to the collective legacy of human knowledge right in our pocket. The energy industry is witnessing the rise of distributed renewable energy networks powered by the internet of things, often financially incentivized through sharing economy systems and blockchain networks. Logistics and transportation is marked by a rise in automation, and coordination through the internet of things. Distributed production is now possible thanks to 3D-printing, fabrication labs, and other increasingly inexpensive, replicable technologies that empower the â€œprosumerâ€ (producer-consumer).The financial system has not gone unaffected either. We are witnessing a transition from national banks and fiat currencies, private equity and investment banking toward blockchain technology and decentralized cryptocurrencies running on public blockchains, and various forms of crowdfunding including equity crowdfunding, and initial coin (ICO) and security token (STO) offerings. The transition is in its nascent stages and will take one or more decades to tip the scales; however, many nation-states are already attempting to adopt or co-opt these trends as evidenced by the rise of state-backed cryptocurrencies (see Venezuelaâ€™s Petro, Russiaâ€™s plans for an oil-backed state cryptocurrency, Chinaâ€™s â€œChinaCoinâ€ currently being tested in Shenzhen). Likewise, Bitcoin is rising in popularity as a currency and store of value in nation-states experiencing hyper-inflation like Venezuela.Cryptocurrency and blockchain have unlocked new tools that networked groups can use to rewrite the operating systems of economic and governance structures from the ground up, maximizing participation and innovation.Blockchain technology is fundamentally a driver of decentralization, unlike prominent twentieth century â€œone to manyâ€ technologies like radio, television, and print newspaper. Blockchain is a â€œmany-to-many,â€ censorship-resistant communication technology, facilitating the emergence of non-hierarchical networked economic and political structures.One beautiful example that combines a number of these principles is the Steem Blockchain, an application-specific blockchain accompanied by the Steem cryptocurrency and the Steemit social media application. The Steemit community has succeeded in bootstrapping an open-source ecosystem that delivers censorship-resistant social media, while incentivizing authors and content creators to monetize attention and information by awarding quality content producers with cryptocurrency through a decentralized meritocratic voting system. A strong community and advanced digital governance system steers the evolution of the ecosystem. A number of newer open-source applications have been built on top of the Steem Blockchain to enhance the ecosystem and increase the utility of Steem, including dtube, a censorship-resistant YouTube clone that leverages the InterPlanetary File System to store video content.Spaces and the experience of those spaces can be designed to optimize specific changes in consciousness. Many bodies of knowledge have been developed throughout history, including the art of feng shui, the varied applications of sacred geometry to architecture, and the careful attention to detail in ceremonial and spiritual spaces of worship across cultures, geographies, and centuries.In our case, the target outcome is to the direct the conscious awareness toward the realization that a different world is possible today, founded upon a decentralized political economy.The laws of attraction (â€œif you build it, they will comeâ€) can be leveraged to crowdsource innovation in prototyping physical spaces embodying a decentralized political economy.When a theory is put into practice and becomes a lived experience, it can become instilled in an individual or group of individuals as a strong belief, and can eventually become the guiding story for a new culture.Author Charles Eisenstein speaks eloquently to the need for a new story â€” a new framework for understanding the world that allows us to dream a different future into being. Similarly, author John Perkins, in his seminal work Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, alludes to this necessity when he receives a message from an Ecuadorian shaman deep in the Amazon rainforest:â€œThe world is as you dream it,â€ he said at last. â€œYour people dreamed of huge factories, tall buildings, as many cars as there are raindrops in this river. Now you begin to see that your dream is a nightmare.â€ He bent to pick up a stone. â€œThe problem is your country is like this pebble.â€ He threw it far out into the river. â€œEverything you do ripples across the Mother.â€â€” Numi, Shuar Shaman (12)The very act of existing within a space largely outside the influence of centralized systems imbues a sense of psychological empowerment amongst the inhabitants. The freedom from outside influence allows us to experience ourselves as we truly are, and opens space for the pursuit of our human potential.I believe that each human being has a purpose on this earth. The greatest pursuit is to discover our purpose, and then take the steps to realize and strive for that purpose. Many human beings never get this opportunity due to the circumstances and conditions that they are born into. When one is beholden to outside elements, it can take one or more generations to cast off these burdens and open the possibility to explore the trajectory of potential.Beyond the individual psyche, there are larger-scale political effects of the empowerment that results from local control of resources and the means of production. When citizens are no longer dependent on corporations, authoritarian governments, and public utility companies to meet their basic needs, they are better able to act autonomously and stand up for their basic rights. They also have more control over the inflow and outflow of capital and resources, and are able to prevent extractive practices that suck rural areas dry (sometimes, quite literally).Individuals and communities can find empowerment through self-sufficiency, resource autonomy, and networks of local interdependence in order to become truly sovereign.This is the vision NuMundo holds for the planet.NuMundo is a global experiment in prototyping the future of living outside centralized systems. It is a database of possibilities for what human coexistence can look like. It is a living, breathing network of communities that exchange a flow of humans and information, sharing knowledge and best practices.Individuals are able to travel throughout the network and witness experiments in coexistence in more than 100 countries. NuMundo facilitates the â€œdecentralized lifestyleâ€ on two levels: 1) enabling the nomadic live anywhere lifestyle, and 2) empowering individuals to live outside of centralized systems, learn this knowledge, and spread it. With the recent integration of a blockchain-based payment technology developed by Coinpayments, individuals can explore the â€œnu worldâ€ using the new financial system of decentralized cryptocurrencies.In the future, NuMundo will host its own network token to facilitate the flow and sharing of value throughout the network, and link to a governance system that will empower the networkâ€™s actors to have a voice in its development.The impact centers featured on the NuMundo network are experimental living centers for the healthy, fulfilling, sustainable lifestyles of tomorrow â€” â€œpeak living.â€ Impact centers are ecovillages, intentional communities, organic farms and sustainability education centers, retreat centers and indigenous communities.These centers are the nodes of the network, where it comes to life. Impact centers are prototyping a decentralized political economy on a micro-scale:I believe that we as a species have all the tools available today to implement a decentralized political economy on a global scale. The solutions will emerge not from the status, but from a decentralized network of innovators, experiments, â€œstart-up societies,â€ and spaces existing at the edges of the current paradigm.Want to be part of it?Telegramâ€”t.me/numundoApply to become an ambassador â€” http://ambassadors.numundo.orgTravel to an impact center â€” www.numundo.org/centersTake our course on conscious travel â€” www.numundo.org/transformational-travel-bootcampAuthor: David CaseyEditor: Toby Israel----2Connecting communities and ecovillages around the globe. www.numundo.orgNuMundo--NuMundo--2NuMundo--NuMundo--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Alex Mathers--220HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Not because she was unpopular or unloved. But because a disjointed lifestyle teamed up with other complexities made it possible for her to disappear.Itâ€™s more gruesome than that, too. When the remains of her body were found, her TV had been on for three years. Her heating didnâ€™t fail once. Joyce had been sat on her sofa, wrapping Christmas presents that nobody would receive. People who had lost touch for one reason or another, or had presumed she didnâ€™t want to hear from them. Mostly, they figured she was away doing more exciting things than hanging out with them, says Carol Morley, the filmmaker who documented Joyceâ€™s story.Misrepresented by the bare, morbid facts of how she died, this young womanâ€™s life and death is now an outright misery.Who would choose that for their own existence (or demise)?Using technology, there must be another way for us to live.As people, we are anything but straightforward. Entrenched in our own unpredictable behaviours and wayward thoughts, technology canâ€™t serve us all at once. For as much as we can care for the wellbeing of others, both you and I are inherently wrapped up in the daily struggle of our own personal lives.Right now, weâ€™re busy building smart homes and connected cities around populations of people. But what about the individuals within those groups and our day-to-day encounters as human beings? In advance of smart homes, we need smart humans. A way to hold close a digital shadow that follows you wherever you go; intangible clothing that you wear like a digital cloak.And I donâ€™t mean a fake digital self you can portray on social media. Hauling around that lie already sits heavy on our collective conscience â€” weâ€™re bored of airbrushing, and women, in particular, are campaigning for a more natural appearance without makeup and with unshaved armpits. Yet as much as our physical being matters, so does our ever-growing digital existence.Technology lends a way for us to control the trail of our actuality and preserve it beyond our death. But first, we have to figure out how to better align our online and offline worlds, instead of tripping ourselves up on inaccurate replicas of ourselves.Thatâ€™s the title of a 2010 TED talk by Cyborg Anthropologist, Amber Case, and itâ€™s hard to deny. Alongside an online social identity, we have a growing collection of digital belongings that we can barely contain. Photos, messages, documents, and downloads litter our lives. A stream of information and entertainment comes at us at an alarming rate.Instant messages.Push notifications.Emails.Scheduling reminders.Texts and photos.Sometimes, even phone callsâ€¦We never switch off.Digital Anthropologist, Brian Solis, calls us Generation C for being Connected â€” always. To our phones. To our online accounts. To our digital network.We collect not just digitised odds and ends, but real-life assets too. A digital wallet collects currency and you can store title deeds for your house on the blockchain. Consider how much more digital junk you will have collected a decade from now as we continue to find new use cases for emerging technology.Over time, our digital estate becomes unmanageable. Like a virtual loft space that contributes to our existential clutter.And what happens to it all when you die?Ten years ago social media sites had drawn in only 7% of the US population. Now, itâ€™s 65%. This dual online-offline existence isnâ€™t limited to the minority any more. We all have to face up to the reality that weâ€™re amassing a lot of digital belongings that become difficult to organise manually.Wouldnâ€™t it be far easier, more convenient, and less time-consuming to log our own humanity in real time?Nobody but us can recognise our feelings of mortality. The sensation of breath feeding in and out of your own lungs. The sadness that drowns you when someone you love is gone forever.Money becomes inconsequential when you start to question what really matters: A loving bond with family and friendsâ€¦ that call to check if youâ€™re okay. All the time, we uncover new technological solutions for human problems and for every stage of our lives.The Bluetooth baby thermometer invented by a Mum who knows what it is to have a sick child, desperate to keep a better track of temperature readings without disturbing the babyâ€™s sleep. Now you can check it wirelessly.The World Identity Network who want to store ID on the blockchain to help prevent child trafficking. â€œNearly half of the worldâ€™s children under the age of five have no official proof of their identityâ€, which leaves them practically invisible and certainly vulnerable, they say.Thereâ€™s a 3D-printed smart pill that heals you when youâ€™re sick, releasing medicine directly into your stomach. And AI therapy bots that are helping the men who struggle to talk to open up, simply by offering them a different way to do it.Virtual Reality is relieving loneliness in old age, allowing our elders to replay their own happy memories via VR headsets. Who doesnâ€™t want to remember the good times?Even after a death, we continue to find ways to connect on a human level using technology. Take the Dadbot created by journalist, James Vlahos. He took digital recordings of his late father speaking and singing, then fed them into an AI bot. Now he can spark a conversation with his deceased Dad to hear his reply, albeit artificially.Your body is becoming more important to your technological experience with the advancement of emerging tech like Augmented Reality. The combination can tell the story about the truth of your existence, but it has to be more than a futuristic fantasy. Any tech we introduce has to be simple enough to integrate into everyday life, like carrying your keys or your phone.â€œItâ€™s not that machines are taking overâ€, says Amber Case in her TED talk. â€œItâ€™s that theyâ€™re helping us to be more human, helping us to connect with each other. The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives. And really, it ends up being more human than technology, because weâ€™re co-creating each other all the timeâ€.It should be effortless, secure, and â€” above all â€” a comfort. More an expression of how we show up in life and in death. A way to track that you are here at all because thatâ€™s what matters the most. The problem arises when the technology is abused.The crew at Cambridge Analytica would have been sweating over their mousepads to get their hands on information like this. Rather than fumble around in peopleâ€™s social media profiles and sneak out their data, a digital cloak would provide them instead with a fully-formed encyclopaedia of the living.So how do we assert control over our digital soul?â€œI believe that the boldest new technologies can help us flourish as human beings. Or destroy the very thing that makes us human. Itâ€™s our choice.â€ ~ Caterina Fake, producer of the tech podcast Should This ExistWhen the UKâ€™s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport proposes â€œan independent watchdog that will write a â€˜code of practiceâ€™ for tech companiesâ€, there are challenges made to their ideas.Matthew Lesh of the neoliberal Adam Smith Institute said: â€œThe government should be ashamed of themselves for leading the western world in internet censorshipâ€. And Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group said it would â€œcreate state regulation of the speech of millions of British citizensâ€.Dr Wendy Moncur of the University of Dundee and the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath highlights another issue with our attempts to legislate: Laws change between countries.If you marry in the UK and are a homosexual couple, your husband or wife is your next of kin. They can inherit your digital estate. In a country where gay marriage is illegal, this next of kin policy is automatically redundant.When the inventor of our World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, suggests that we introduce a contract to facilitate â€œour journey from digital adolescence to a more mature, responsible and inclusive futureâ€, heâ€™s knocked back too:â€œThis isnâ€™t about the companies themselves. Itâ€™s about the people running those companies. Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, Theranos â€” those are all broken entities because the people running them are ethically brokenâ€, said Michael Girdley, MD of tech venture capital firm Geekdom Fund.Then there are Stanford Professors Fei-Fei Li and John Etchemendy who in March 2019 opened a new centre for â€œHuman-Centered AIâ€ (HAI). Their launch video confirms the goal: to â€œrepresent humanityâ€ with â€œpolicyâ€ and â€œbest practiceâ€ in AI. In real terms, they say this means looking at how we use AI to â€œmake a writer be a better writer, or an artist be a more creative artist, or make a teacher be a more empathetic and understanding teacherâ€.This approach might be the best we can hope for right now, but the technology itself has to play its part too. We need to be able to trust our devices. In our physical lives, we talk about airborne diseases like Chickenpox. In our digital lives, itâ€™s BlueBorne, a flaw that lets hackers get into your devices via Bluetooth.Well, weâ€™re individuals and weâ€™ll each do what suits us best.Trusting someone else with your digital shadow feels like a vulnerability, even if you assign a digital executor. Because when would this mechanism kick in? For Joyce Vincent, a representative failed to appear. Nobody even knew that her pulse had stopped thumping. A heart rate monitor might have known. And could a device like that not automatically raise the alarm?The filmmaker who etched Joyce Vincentâ€™s name into our brains so we donâ€™t forget her describes horrific cases of assumption. People who didnâ€™t know Joyce suggested that she â€œmust have been a right miserable cowâ€ and somehow â€œdeservedâ€ any misfortune she suffered before her death.Perhaps if they had heard her laughter or known how often she danced it would be a more powerful reminder of her humanity. Rather than interviews in a studio with people who knew her once. More moving even than the bewitching recreation of her existence for the Dreams of a Life documentary.If Joyce had been found sooner, along with a collection of data that could have told us what to do with her body and her belongings, her existence might have been less mysterious.If only somebody â€” anybody â€” had known her whereabouts or could see reports about her health in the days, hours, and minutes before she took her final breath.Maybe then weâ€™d have a better understanding of who Joyce was. Weâ€™d know the real Joyce, whoever she was, that she herself would have wanted us to see.Canâ€™t we all hope for that?Originally posted on https://nataliesmithson.com/blog----Digital Innovation Copywriter making human connections in a digital world ðŸ™Œ Medium is where I collect my thoughts âœ«å½¡ More at nataliesmithson.com/natterNatalie Smithson--Natalie Smithson--Natalie Smithson--Natalie Smithson--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"
124,45522,https://medium.com/@sebastianzuigalopez/the-4th-industrial-revolution-is-coming-86129e680064?source=tag_archive---------57-----------------------,The 4th industrial revolution is coming,None,Sebastian ZuÃ±iga Lopez,https://medium.com/@sebastianzuigalopez,3,1,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*oTEJ4x3U6eWZjb7lWSeptA.jpeg","Sebastian ZuÃ±iga LopezFollow--ListenShareThis â€œstoryâ€ is going to be about a book I read about a fourth industrial revolution written by Klaus Schwab. I do not really like to read, but I really enjoyed reading this book. I consider it as a pretty understandable lecture and you do not really get bored by reading it.The subject of the book is something that I consider should be more known by the general people, I think only the ones who are in the bussiness world are really aware of this, but this is something that I really think will happen soon and that will affect all the world in very different ways. Some positive and also really negative ways, I do not think we as the society are giving it the awareness or importance it should be given, and it could become something like the 2009 financial crisis (where only the ones who knew about what was coming, got good things about it).In a very simple way, the fourth industrial revolution is the projection of what technology will create in a very near future. This industrial revolution is the one that could have a bigger impact in the society because of the rapidity of the technology improvement and innovation. With the huge increase of technology, the automatization is something that we just have to wait to happen. It is already been implemented in different areas, but what the fourth industrial revolution mentions or establishes is that technology will get to a point that humans will not be required in the process. This point can and will affect a huge amount of the population in the world because many people will not be needed by companies and will lose their jobs, and if they were specialized in what they used to do, then they will have a rough time ahead. Also by taking this point, some college careers will become useless because technology will dominate those areas. And as a student, that really made me think about how the near future can be something really scary, if people had trouble with competition to be â€œsuccesfullâ€ in the past or now, now imagine by having also the machines as competition.The world has gotten to a point where you need to innovate, create new ideas to overcome the difficulties that have been established. In the lecture innovation is something mentioned a lot, because it is very important nowadays even more than before. Because as technology grows, old established things become obsolete, and you need to adapt to the new world that is being created.For example, companies like Uber that were pionners in this technological bussines innovation (I consider it as that). Uber adapted to the actual peopleÂ´s neccesities and demands and came up with this new concept of something that has been around since the creation of cars. But not only companies need to adapt to this new cybernetical world, also governmets and countries need it so they can keep having control in this new revolution. Developing countries and third world countries must find a way to innovate or adapt or they could be left behind (even more). First world countries such as USA are betting in these new ways of implementing or prioritizing the technology and that is what will make them continue be global powers.This industrial revolution also comes with very positive ideas or prjections, such as medical discoveries or improvements that could not have been achieved in decades. Also having an even more connected world through many channels, technology can also be a very needed solution for the environment, we are in a position where if we continue polluting the world, we might end our existence in the world. So I see two possible solutions by the technology huge improvement, we can stop the damage we have done by creating what we humans use daily in a way where we dont do harm or a colder way of thinking: by emigrating to another planet.This new technological era can be what saves all of us, but it could also be something that makes a lot of us obsolete. So as a conclusion I can say that this is happening and really soon, so we should be prepared to understand it and to adapt to it to survive in the real world.----Sebastian ZuÃ±iga Lopez--Sebastian ZuÃ±iga Lopez----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

As a company experiences hypergrowth, processes and structures break. I find it fascinating to see how teams learn and improve in this environment. In this interview, find out how our Android team grew and scaled. I sat down with Mustafa Mutlu, one of our Android Engineers, to get some relevant insights.PK: Please tell me a little bit about your background.My name is Mustafa. I joined N26 about a year ago in April. Before that I was working in Istanbul, Turkey. I have three years of Android experience. I enjoy working at N26 and living in Berlin. I spent most of my time in the â€œPayment Schemersâ€ team in the â€œPayments Group.â€ Weâ€™re focused on bringing more features to the UK and follow up after our launch last year. Iâ€™m also now working towards the US launch and excited about that as well.PK: You mentioned working as an Android Engineer in Istanbul. How would you describe the difference between how the team here works and how youâ€™ve worked in the past?My previous employer in Istanbul was a lot smaller. We didnâ€™t have several offices with lots of people working on the same application. N26 is a hypergrowth, scaleup company. Weâ€™ve grown rapidly and kept the same startup values. Itâ€™s not one of those huge companies where you donâ€™t talk to people outside of your team. Everyone is very approachable. You can always approach anyone with your feedback or questions. Itâ€™s nice to have this openness and transparency.In the Android team we are now about twenty people.PK: Itâ€™s massive!Yes. When I first joined, we were twelve people and it had doubled in size. We are growing exponentially, which is very exciting. At the same time, as we grow, we face new challenges on how we work as a team. Weâ€™ve had to evolve our processes.PK: Whatâ€™s an example of a process you had to evolve?We run events called â€œKnowledge Sharing Events.â€ We have a weekly one-hour meeting focused on knowledge sharing. In the past, we met face-to-face in a room. We shared our screen, walked through code we recently wrote or discussed a problem we recently solved. I found it very helpful when I first started and still find it useful today. We also learn more about what everyone else works on. If you introduce a new component or a new way to solve a problem, this is the perfect place to share the knowledge.After expanding the Android team to our Barcelona office, we had to evolve these â€œKnowledge Sharing Events.â€ In our current process, we create a new page on our wiki for each meeting. Every engineer who wants to share something prepares by writing topics and details to share in that page. In the meeting, we connect remotely, walk through the page and discuss.Itâ€™s better because itâ€™s based on documentation that you can later refer to. Information is not lost. If you donâ€™t have time to attend the meeting, or if youâ€™re on holidays, you can still catch up. We like to think itâ€™s like an internal blog we use to share information with each other.PK: Thatâ€™s a great scaling idea. You can also go back to something you discussed in the past.Yes! We also know finding information is important. We also keep the pages indexed so others can easily search and find relevant information. Our â€œKnowledge Sharing Eventsâ€ used to be ad hoc face to face discussion. Weâ€™ve scaled up our practice to work remotely and more asynchronously. I think we tackled this challenge nicely. It works very well.PK: Much more scalable, too.Indeed! I expect we will continue to grow. Like when we have an Android Engineer in our New York office, we think this practice will scale well.PK: What have you learned so far since joining N26?Before I joined, I saw Luciaâ€™s article on the Reactive Clean Architecture. We use this here at N26. It excited me because I have never used a Reactive Architecture before. We use RxJava intensively. I wanted to learn more about this and have learned a lot about how to use it since joining.I have also learned how we evolve our architecture. During one of our team meetings, we shared what we thought the weakest aspects of our architecture was. We also brainstormed as a team on how to address them.PK: It sounds like a great technical retrospective, focused on the Android architecture.Right! We used post-its and everything like in a normal retrospective. It was great that all Android engineers contributed to this. We have already improved some of these areas, and have plans for others. Our architecture is battle-tested to support the features we need and the variety of devices we have to support.PK: What else have you learned?Our team works very closely with a team of Barcelona. This means working like a distributed team across two locations. Our daily standups and ceremonies are therefore held remotely. Iâ€™ve never had that experience before and it works very effectively.PK: Out of all the teams at N26 I know of, your team is probably pioneering these experiences and practices. More teams will need to learn from yours as our company continues to grow and becomes more distributed!Yes, I agree. I have learned so much. Now that we have New York and Barcelona, there are lots of lessons to share.PK: Iâ€™ve heard about the Android core team. Tell me more about it and how it works.Our Android team members normally work as part of cross-functional product teams. We also have a small, dedicated Android core team that does not contribute to product features. Itâ€™s a rotation-based team with a couple of permanent members. You join for a month, and then return to your cross-functional product team.In the core team, we like to say, â€œYou develop features for features.â€ You provide essential building blocks for other Android engineers. Those other Android engineers are more focused on product features.As part of the core team, you also have more time to explore the latest Android technologies. You assess if theyâ€™re relevant for us. If it makes sense, you might even implement a technical spike to learn about them. Of course we then distribute those learnings as part of the â€œKnowledge Sharing Events.â€I learned a lot during my time as part of the core team. We had some cross-platform goals like improving modularisation, unifying our design approach, and expanding test and release automation. I improved modularisation by implementing a common navigation tool and method. I also added in more automation and instrumentation to our tests. These reduce our release cycle and better locate errors in our regression tests.PK: The rotating core team is a very nice model. You get to work on both a feature in particular domain and you get to work on some platform-like features. You get some variety this way.Thatâ€™s right. We like to describe that we are members of two teams. Iâ€™m part of a cross-functional Product Team. At the same time, we like to think of ourselves as Android Ambassadors for that Product team. We are people who offer Android insights to help Product teams achieve their goals.As an Android team, we also need to align so that the codebase is consistent. We aim to build a codebase that looks like a single person wrote it. We donâ€™t want it to look like twenty different people wrote it, because we want to easily rotate to different parts. We continue to develop ways to distribute knowledge to ensure we are always up to date with others.We work well as an Android team. Iâ€™m always aware of what other Android team members are working on. It doesnâ€™t mean I know the detail. I do know who to approach on particular topics if I want to find out more. Itâ€™s very nice.PK: It sounds like youâ€™ve learned a lot since being here. Thereâ€™s also been a lot of change. What is one change youâ€™re proud of working on?I was part of what we called, a â€œUK Taskforce.â€ Launching the UK required a lot of contributions from many teams in the company. My team was responsible for updating our application to offer UK customers the best experience. We had to touch a lot of different places in the application. I am one of the very few people who touched a lot of files at least once as a result.PK: I bet your Git username is all over the codebase (laughing)Yes (laughing). Thatâ€™s probably right. Launching in the UK was our first experience launching a non-Euro currency in the app. There are also subtle localisation differences we had to support.Iâ€™m proud that we accomplished this so rapidly. Weâ€™re also taking some lessons learned and applying them as we work towards the US launch. This is even more exciting.To summarise though, Iâ€™m proud we made the UK launch and enabled new customers to enjoy the N26 experience in another country.PK: Itâ€™s not easy launching a bank into a new regional area. Particularly when itâ€™s completely different currency. Is there anything else youâ€™d like to share as we come to a close?Yes. I have three things to share.First, I have a suggestion to Android Engineers to always write good quality tests. At N26 we expect engineers to write unit tests. If you open a Pull Request without unit tests, reviewers will definitely comment on that. We also introduced writing UI tests a few months back. Weâ€™re starting to see the benefits of these UI tests to ensure our features are always working. Always write good unit and UI tests. Make sure that your code is working as expected. You should always test things.PK: Thatâ€™s definitely a hard bit about software. Not breaking things when you make a change. Whatâ€™s the second point?Secondly, itâ€™s very important to be as transparent as possible. Itâ€™s especially important if youâ€™re working in a collaborative environment. Working in a team requires transparency and trust. Always be transparent. Give and receive feedback with your teammates. N26 is good with this.We often have Q&A with co-founders in the company. With C-level people. I like these sessions as you get to ask questions from people you donâ€™t often to talk to. You get to learn more. You get to see things from their eyes. Itâ€™s very helpful.PK: And your final point?Last but not least. Have fun! Having fun is one of the most underrated things. I also think itâ€™s one of the most important ingredients. Work shouldnâ€™t be tedious or boring. It should be fun.PK: Great advice and a great perspective in life as well! Thank you very much for sharing more about the Android team and your own experiences.If youâ€™d like to join us on the journey of building the mobile bank the world loves to use, have a look at the Android Engineer roles weâ€™re looking for here.----InsideN26Tech Leader.

Also, equal, if not more, are the people who claim they â€˜understandâ€™ all dynamics & intricacies of this new-age tech, but they donâ€™t.And as they say, half knowledge is worse than ignorance.Blockchain, in its crude form, is a type of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) whose append-only nature provides a robust mechanism to store data in data blocks. These blocks are linked cryptographically via hash functions, making it virtually impossible to change data of a particular block without disturbing the rest of the block sequence that followed. Simply put, itâ€™s like a growing set of public record that carries a possibility to disrupt multiple industries and streamline their business operations. Bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies are the most popular use cases of Blockchain.Now, among the good and the bad they say about Blockchain, there are certain misleading â€˜factsâ€™ as well which are propagated without second thoughts. Today, weâ€™ll debunk some common myths and misconceptions whirling around Blockchain-Blockchain is like the new big data or AI â€” too many people are using it as a buzzword and not focused solving a real problem. We like to call them Blockchain tourists!These words from Rippleâ€™s CEO Brad Garlinghouse sums up all that we have to say.We agree the code is powerful, but itâ€™s not a solution to all sorts of problems. You need to weigh if your business has scope to introduce a Blockchain innovation or align one with your legacy systems to exploit the power of decentralisation. Ask yourself, will Blockchain enhance consumer consumption? Will it help in cost savings? Will I see a surge in productivity? How many practical use cases are there for my industry? Analyse all aspects effectively and see if Blockchain implementation is worthwhile. Before making any mind, connect with Blockchain experts for a consultation to better recognise the disrupting capabilities of Blockchain for your business.Things people say!By design and definition, Blockchain is a distributed database, making a large number of people think (and believe) that Blockchain is a sophisticated storage mechanism. Letâ€™s burst the bubble- itâ€™s one of the perks that arrives when itâ€™s used as an exchange application. Blockchain wasnâ€™t devised to store your comprehensive data but to store information as a transaction, with which you can see every piece of data generating a hash. The hash can be used to verify the authenticity of that data, thus skyrocketing trust and transparency.Well, they are not.Blockchain has Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and tokens, and they are not synonymous.Coins bring along a single utility- they act as digital money and can be used to buy or sell things. They can be received, sent, or mined and are not meant to perform any function other than serving as a medium of exchange.Tokens, on the other hand, are digital assets that can have one or more functions inside a project ecosystem. They can act as coins and also represent an asset or utility.We get it- Blockchain gained the recognition it deserves after the unprecedented popularity of Bitcoin. But is Blockchain all about Bitcoin? Absolutely not!One who has familiarity with the potential of Blockchain can tell you in a heartbeat that Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg. The real-world applications and use cases of Blockchain are making waves in the digital world and positively impacting multitudinous industries; Finance, Healthcare, and Logistics to name a few. Bitcoin is just a cryptocurrency designed to facilitate secure online transactions.To understand Blockchain beyond Bitcoin, check our blog- 5 Practical Non-Bitcoin Applications of BlockchainYet another misconception about Blockchain relates with its ability to scale. Blockchain is widely positioned as â€œgrowing list of recordsâ€, giving an impression that Blockchain can be scaled to an infinite extent. Well, this isnâ€™t the case.Blockchain canâ€™t be scaled, at least now.The decentralised consensus mechanism of Blockchain comes with gold-like benefits- fault tolerance, sky-high security, and political neutrality, but associates the big-time pain of scalability. The number of transactions the blockchain can process cannot exceed that of a single node which is participating in the network. It is also to be noted that with the addition of every new node, the phenomenon of inter-node latency comes into play that makes Blockchain weaker. Hope this clears why Blockchain canâ€™t be scaled endlessly.So, this was our effort to dispel the myths about Blockchain and add more clarity to your knowledge base.

Without him, Bitcoin would not exist today. Hal is a far better coder than I will ever hope to be. You see, Iâ€™m not a specialist. The initial versions of Bitcoin had a lot of problems. To put it simply, they fell over and crashed repeatedly.Unfortunately, Hal was also a big part of a problem. He got it eventually, but more than anyone else, I think he made me doubt. Iâ€™d been working on a solution to a problem that is now expressed as Bitcoin since the 90s. It had resulted in battles with organisations that I had founded early on, in fights with people who did not want to spend so much money on R&D. Without Bitcoin, the earliest decades of my life would have been much easier.Hal was far more the anarchist than I could ever imagine. I had many in my circle who were anarchist in nature, and I didnâ€™t really think about the utopian goals they held and problems they could cause later on. Hal wanted people to run nodes early on. He is the reason that we had a block cap. I knew that I should have fought back and not have allowedÂ it.The scarcity in Bitcoin is defined in the number of issued tokens. Hence itâ€™s an integer, and there cannot be more decimal places. As much as Hal was a great supporter, he also saw flaws that didnâ€™t exist within Bitcoin.Towards the end of 2010, I had become incredibly disillusioned. It wasnâ€™t just issues with the Australian government, but rather issues with many parts of life in general.I didnâ€™t run away from Bitcoin, but I needed to know more about the system I created. Most critically, I needed to know that it could work at scale as I had planned. Towards the end of 2010, WikiLeaks had started promoting Bitcoin as an end to their woes. WikiLeaks and I have not had a good relationship.Shortly after, the dark web and most prominently Silk Road started integrating Bitcoin. As a system that was designed with an audit trail, Bitcoin was designed not to be even remotely similar to the anonymous digital cash that had been propagated earlier and promoted in systems such as CHL, Monex, and DigiCash.Bitcoin was supposed to solve all their issues, and yet I saw such sites starting to rely on Bitcoin. More importantly, unlike even the more anonymous eCash that had been shut down, Bitcoin was being used on the dark web and not on banks. eCash had been accepted by organisations such as the Deutsche Bank, before it was closed down and the attitude of people involved in the community ensured that no bank or responsible organisation was touching it.Bitcoin started to seem to me to be delivering everything I was opposed to, and everything I thought it was designed not to be started to appear. So, all I can say is that I was disillusioned.Even Hal started to get it. In December 2010, Hal said:â€œUltimately itâ€™s good for the network for mining to be expensive. It makes it that much harder for a well financed attacker to dominate the network.â€So, unlike the earlier idea of needing to put a cap on and slowly build to allow many nodes, he started to get it. Unfortunately, by the time I was already disillusioned.He still saw Bitcoin as the store-of-value and digital-gold idea, though.â€œI see Bitcoin as ultimately becoming a reserve currency for banks, playing much the same role as gold did in the early days of banking. Banks could issue digital cash with greater anonymity and lighter weight, more efficient transactions.â€He never got around to understanding how efficient Bitcoin can be. I guess we all have baggage that weighs us down from the ideas we had before. For Hal, it was the cypherpunk concept of money and digital cash. It is not what Bitcoin is, nor is it what Bitcoin was designed to be.What I have learned, and I have learned the lesson very well, is that you cannot teach other people and you cannot make them learn. You can provide material and give them a path to learning.With people like Hal, Iâ€™ve come to learn that no matter how much you like someone, it is not worth investing in saving one person from a flawed idea to the exclusion of offering a means of teaching others. I have learned the hard way not to focus on an individual, not to try and save them but rather to get material out allowing as many people as possible to learnâ€Šâ€”â€Šand first those who seek to learn.Learning is a privilege, not a right. It has to be earnt. It is a proof of work in itself. Some people think that itâ€™s important for me to come out and bring everybody in as quickly as I can, except it is utterly wrong.My time, as with everyoneâ€™s, is incredibly limited. We live short fast lives, and unlike many people, I do not have time to waste. So, I only want the people who really really really want to learn. The people who are going to take what they have learnt and create and build and grow the ecosystem.Do you think I care anymore? Itâ€™s funny that you do. With close to 1,200 papers in our patent pipeline, no matter what happens now, I will have exceeded Mr. Edison, and by the time Iâ€™m finished between everything I publish, Iâ€™m hoping to actually achieve 10,000 papers. The funny thing is, you think saying anything against me stopsÂ whatÂ IÂ amÂ doing. It doesnâ€™t. But it does give me a laugh.In 2010 and early 2011, I was disillusioned as I saw Bitcoin used in a way that it was designed not to be usedÂ in. The funny thing is, the people later proved I was right. Because of Bitcoin, Silk Road was stopped, and many of the people behind it are now in prison. It didnâ€™t make things easier at the time, but it is a nice vindication now.I needed to go away, and I needed to prove to myself that the system I had created worked the way Iâ€™d intended. It does, and it always did.Such is some of the irony I can see in boondoggle attempts to create something that Bitcoin was designed not to be, to try and make it more into something that Hal and Wei wouldâ€™ve designed.Lightning and sidechains are designed to lose records, to allow the creation of an anonymous system that loses records. The reason for the BSA is not consumer protection, it is to ensure that all financial institutions maintain records. Interestingly, everything that is being done to create Lightning and off-chain solutions is the reason why failed cryptocurrencies of the 90s were shut down. The irony is that Bitcoin can only be legal by keeping all records of transactions.â€œThe Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended and implemented by regulations passed by FinCEN [Financial Crime Enforcement Network], requires a wide-swath of otherwise unregulated financial institutions to register with the government, implement anti-money laundering procedures, keep data, and report certain transactions and other data,â€ Reuben Grinberg, a lawyer for Davis Polk & Wardwell, wrote in his academic paper on Bitcoin in 2011 â€” again with the flawed misconception many try to spread that Bitcoin is anonymous.When you start to lose records, the concept Lightning and sidechains are designed to create, sidelining the currency altogether becomes simple and effective. â€œUnder the statute, FinCEN has power to prevent US financial institutions from dealing with institutions that deal with Bitcoin, which would essentially outlaw it in the US,â€ Grinberg (in Quartz). â€œPreviously in interviews I have said that I think itâ€™s unlikely that the US Government would just outright ban Bitcoin. But this action shows that its not impossible.â€Well, not Bitcoin, but, Lightning.Liberty Reserve was based in Costa Rica, which is not a member of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), the international organisation that collaborates on anti-money-laundering (AML) rules. And yet, Costa Rican authorities cooperated with the US government (which is a member).----6My opinions are my own.

Yu Zhibei, co-founder of Yunphant Blockchain was invited to the summit. At the summit, Yu said that from the nature of blockchain and the trend of technology development, blockchain can be highly expected in the future. First of all, blockchain essentially solves the problem of trust and information asymmetry, which is needed for the development of society as a whole. Secondly, from the perspective of technology development, with the reduction of hardware costs and the development of technologies such as 5G, some technical bottlenecks currently faced by the blockchain will be gradually solved.2.

Big Data and Cloud Computing are â€” in essence â€” very different technologies. Big data is content, and cloud computing represents infrastructure. Both, however, lie at the heart of the IT industry and when you combine the two, it can yield incredible results. For instance, with the help of Cloud Computing, Big Data can be processed on your computer system with ease. However, before we dive into the specifics of their compatibility, letâ€™s first break down the two technologies. What is Big Data? And what is Cloud Computing?What is Big Data?Simply put, Big Data is a term that represents large volumes of data, (either structured or unstructured) which businesses receive on a day-to-day basis. Big Data can be defined using three parameters â€” also known as the three â€œVsâ€.Other parameters include value, which refers to the value of the information you receive and veracity, which deals with data confidentiality and availability.Big Data is a dynamic field, where content can spike suddenly due to trends on social media, or because of daily, seasonal and event-based occurrences. Data also comes from multiple sources, making it difficult to link, match, clean and transfer to other systems. With the right type of infrastructure, data can be managed efficiently and in a timely manner, before the sheer volume of it spirals out of control.This brings us to Cloud Computing.What is Cloud Computing?A basic definition of Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of computing services (whether that is servers, databases, storage, network, software, analytics and more) over the internet. The cloud offers flexible resources to businesses, faster innovations and scalability. Itâ€™s an incredibly economical option for businesses, as you pay for the cloud services you use. This can help lower operational costs, run the infrastructure of your business efficiently and help you scale your business as your needs grow and change.Cloud computing offers three primary services,The Big Data- Cloud Computing Relationship Defined:Separately, both Big Data and Cloud Computing are valuable on their own. However, businesses are now combining them to get the best of two worlds. Together, they offer a solution that is both scalable and accommodating of Big Data and analytics.Utilising the cloud for Big Data makes it easier to track, analyse and act on insights from the information received. However, if youâ€™re considering using the combination of the two technologies, you should know that the advantages go beyond that. Letâ€™s take a look:So, itâ€™s clear from above that the advantages born from marrying Cloud Computing with Big Data are numerous. With the future ripe for both technologies, it only remains to be seen what the combination of the two will create next!For more interesting articles, subscribe to the Resellerclub Blog.----ResellerClubResellerClubinResellerClub--1ResellerClubinResellerClub--ResellerClubinResellerClub--ResellerClub--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Matt ChapmaninTowards Data Science--21Scott H.

One of the few downsides of Loop is the need to have a RileyLink always in close proximity to our T1D daughter, in addition to the iPhone. I was able to embed the RileyLink into a phone case to create just one unit and have had good success with this solution for the last two weeks.This post will provide step-by-step instructions for embedding a 433MHz RileyLink (Omnipod) into a iPhone 6/7/8 case. Bigger iPhones such as 6+/7+/8+ or X/XS/XR offer more case space to work with and should work just fine as well.AcknowledgementsThe design I describe here is based heavily on the excellent work done by Keith Parisella. I took a different strategy with the battery connection, and needed a different antenna, but Keith did most of the heavy lifting to come up with this solution. Also, I got some valuable feedback and pointers from the bright folks on Facebook Looped group and Loop ZulipChat.What you needStep 1: Remove the battery from the battery case.The inside of the case looks like this:First, pull up gray felt shown, and throw it away. I used a box cutter blade to get it up. I imagine any sharp knife would work.You then see the battery, held down with 8 very small Phillips head screws.Remove the 8 screws (you wonâ€™t need them anymore). You can now pull up the battery.Youâ€™ll see a red (5V supply) and black (ground) wire connected to the battery. Use your wire cutter to cut both of these wires. Cut them fairly close to the battery. You wonâ€™t need the battery Yes, youâ€™re just getting rid of the main thing that you got when you bought the case.Step 2: Cut a hole for the phoneâ€™s charger cord (lightning cable)The way the battery case works is designed to work is that you charge the case battery by plugging in your iPhone cord to the lightning jack in the bottom of the case. You then charge your iPhone by pressing a button to charge your iPhone from the case battery. With the modifications weâ€™re describing, none of that will be the happen anymore. Instead, we will use two charger cables:So, we need to cut out the phone caseâ€™s plug and just leave a hole where your iPhone charger port is.This is a bit of a tricky endeavor. I used a Dremel tool, but you may do better with a thin sheer like this one. Here is the before and after:Step 3: Wire the RileyLink to the case to allow chargingWith the RileyLink inside the phone case, the mini-USB port is no longer positioned to allow charging. Fortunately, the board designers provided alternate locations to solder on charging wires, labeled ALT PWRIt would be most convenient if the black and red wires that you clipped off of the case battery could just be soldered to the case battery. But, for some reason I donâ€™t understand, the red wire does not provide a steady 5V. Instead, the circuitry between the lightning port and the red cable pulse the voltage on the red line between ~4V and ~1V about once per second. This is no way to charge a RileyLink. So, I went looking for a spot to tap off a nice steady 5V.Finding a steady 5V supply point requires removing the plastic over the circuit board at the bottom of the case:Again, I used a Dremel to cut off the plastic.To find a steady 5V supply point, I plugged in the case and hunted around with a voltmeter. I found a good spot and soldered a couple inches of red wire to it as shown:To finish off this step, solder the other side of the red wire to the ALT PWR location on the RileyLink board. To connect ground, I added a bit of black wire to the end of the case ground wire, and soldered that to the other ALT PWR pad on the RileyLink board. If all is working correctly, the red RileyLink LED turns on and says on when the case is hooked up to power via a lightning cable as shown below. The red LED indicates that the battery is charging.Step 4: Replace the AntennaWith the above configuration, I put the RileyLink and battery in the case, put a bit of electrical tape to hold everything in place, and then put in the iPhone. I then tested out the performance. What I found is that the communication between the RileyLink and the Omnipod is very weak due to the metal of the phone being right next to the spiral antenna (Note that I had to de-solder the antenna turn it 90 degrees, and re-solder it in order for it to fit the way I wanted.)With the spiral antenna in place, the 433MHz RF connection to the Omnipod was so weak that it would often fail to make contact to a pod just a few feet away. No good.It turns out that the winning solution couldnâ€™t have been much simpler: with the black wire that came in the soldering kit, I cut a 17cm section (quarter wavelength at 433MHz). I popped off the spiral antenna and soldered one end of the 17cm of wire to the antenna connection pad on the RileyLink board. The length of wire I wrapped around the edge of the usable area of the case. I wanted to get it close to the edge to expose the antenna to as little of the phoneâ€™s ground plane as possible. Here is the final result, with the antenna traced in green for illustration:Wire antenna results: much, much better. With the the RileyLink, battery, and antenna tucked in as shown, and the iPhone in the case, the RileyLink seemed to be able to maintain a good connection to the Omnipod to a distance of 10â€“15 feet. Iâ€™d say the connectivity of this solution is similar to that of a stand alone RileyLink, although measuring connectivity is a bit tricky. Weâ€™ve been using this setup for about two weeks and my daughter is happy with everything other than the plain black case which is much less pretty than the phone cases sheâ€™s used to :-)Advantages of this designDisadvantages of this designWhat did I miss?This design is far from perfect. If you see something that could be made easier or better in my case design, please comment here or in Facebook. Also, if the instructions are unclear, let me know and Iâ€™ll edit.

To truly deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly, the Aurora Driver would need to move people and goods across all vehicle platforms, from compact passengers to commercial vans to Class 8, or heavy-duty trucks.Itâ€™s harder to develop a self-driving system with this flexibility. This work has required a deep investment in foundational hardware and software design to seamlessly integrate across vehicle platforms. But when done right, this approach leads to better performance and lower material costs for all participants on the platform, and increases our ability to deliver on our promise.As we develop the Aurora Driver, we focused first on developing a driver for low-speed operation in interesting urban environments. This exposed our Driver to a more concentrated dose of interesting events for every mile driven and allowed us to hone our offline infrastructure to accelerate development more broadly. Meanwhile, we also integrated our Driver into several different vehicle platforms, from small sedans to a Class 8 truck. Weâ€™ve tested each vehicle at low speeds to ensure our Driver remains versatile to different platforms and their unique behaviors.Through our work, weâ€™ve kept an eye on high-speed operation of vehicles powered by the Aurora Driver, and weâ€™ve been thoughtful about preparing both our technology and our company for this important leap. This preparation ranges from the very tactical steps of designing our garages to accommodate large trucks and training a subset of our team to operate them, to more strategic considerations in our functional safety architecture. While itâ€™s true that highway driving is, for the vast majority of the time, uneventful and monotonous, dangerous events do arise, however infrequently. When they do, they present a significantly more complex and consequential challenge for a heavy, fast-moving vehicle than a light, slow-moving one. Hence the safety bar for this application is high. Meeting it requires a perception system that can reliably see objects at long ranges.And then we welcomed Blackmore into our family.Weâ€™ve invested a considerable amount of time and resources in deeply understanding how perception needs change at high speeds and putting in place key strategic technologies that will allow us to meet them. In addition to our developments in both radar and camera systems, Blackmoreâ€™s industry-leading FMCW lidar is uniquely well suited for the long-range sensing needed to operate a truck safely at highway speeds. Our lidar offers single photon sensitivity, improved resistance to environmental conditions, and simultaneous detection of both the position and velocity of objects. This means the Aurora Driver can detect and track objects more quickly, at greater distances, and with greater precision than was possible with existing technology.The economic and social benefits of self-driving in long-haul trucking are clear. With the addition of the worldâ€™s foremost FMCW lidar as a critical and distinguishing piece of the Aurora Driver, we are excited to expand our Driverâ€™s abilities to higher speed applications.Stay tuned for more updates on our progress in the coming months.----Aurora BlogAurora delivers the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadlyAurora TeaminAurora Blog--4Aurora TeaminAurora Blog--The Aurora TeaminAurora Blog--10Aurora TeaminAurora Blog--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

MÄra has a BA and Masters degrees of Engineering Sciences in Computer Systems from RTU and a wealth of publications and research in Artificial Intelligence. Her current focus is on developing effective computing systems to simulate human group behavior which would eventually be used to assist people with emotional challenges.Evita: Can you tell us about the Riga Technical University and what is your role there?MÄra: RTU is the largest engineering university in Latvia. I am working in the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Systems Engineering. We are doing Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in our department focusing on different applications, such as robotics and intelligent tutoring systems. My main area of research is using AI in the simulation of processes in which intelligent beings are involved. More specifically, Iâ€™m considering the role of emotions in these processes, which is a relatively new direction of AI; to my knowledge, we are the first ones in Latvia who started researching and working on this.Evita: What is your ambition and what is the international focus of your work from the scientific perspective?MÄra: My inspiration for this topic came from the fact that people use a lot of electronics nowadays and thus loose social contact. People who choose to interact with their phones instead of peers lose in the long term, because for example in the job market those who have stronger ability to socialize tend to do better. This means that people need to acquire social skills, for example, how to behave with others appropriately. This, in turn, is closely related to emotional skills, which also called Emotional Intelligence â€” how well we are able to understand and regulate our own emotions and the emotions of others.Currently, our academic systems are focused on developing IQ, but there is very little emphasis on EQ. The acquiring of EQ skills occurs naturally in the classroom while people interact with each other. However, if people donâ€™t interact anymore, there is a problem.My initial idea was to create an artificial playground for kids where they would be able to develop social and emotional skills by interacting with a group of artificial peers, play various scenarios, but would not hurt actual people. Once I started researching, I realized that on the one hand there has been quite a lot done in this area, but on the other hand, not nearly enough. I have currently put aside developing something like this for children since it involves many more challenges, as children require very specific strategies and tactics; additionally, there is an entirely different layer of ethical perspective when it comes to children.At the same time, to develop something like this for adults, I still need to have a believable enough group of artificial peers; I mean, you donâ€™t want a bunch of robots to socialize with. For communication to make sense, a person using this simulation should believe that s/he is talking to actual humans. Currently, Iâ€™m working on simulating a group of artificial humans who interact with each other and make it as close as possible to human communication.Evita: Your research also looks closely into crowds and predicting their behavior, is it just one part of your work or your main focus?MÄra: Itâ€™s not my main focus but it is a part of my research. A crowd as a structure is a bit simpler than a group of people who know each other, letâ€™s say, co-workers. A crowd has a basic structure and itâ€™s easier to predict its behavior.  When people pass emotions from one to the other, there are several ways for this to happen, which I call mechanisms. When it comes to the crowd, there are just one or two mechanisms involved in passing emotions, while in the work groups there are five mechanisms.  For example, a simple, yet effective mechanism to pass an emotion is to express it verbally; this is a direct manifestation of how you are feeling at this moment â€” we often use it with people we know.In a crowd, direct emotion expression does not work. Instead, we use a mechanism based on mimicry. People tend to mimic the emotions of others: if someone smiles, we tend to smile; such behavior is coded in our low-level social behavior models. This mechanism is called emotion contagion because it occurs exactly like a virus.Itâ€™s much harder to predict the behavior of the coworkers because coworkers have relationships, i.e., a social structure, and have common things that they need to accomplish. More importantly, they have the ability to communicate if they like or dislike the behavior of another person. Therefore, predicting their behavior is so much more difficult. This is why current models that I have were first applied to crowds. Nevertheless, we are also working on scientific research and publications that cover other types of groups.Evita: This sounds interesting, however, doesnâ€™t psychology cover this already? Why do you need a computer to contribute to something that psychologists already know?MÄra: Computer science entails structuring and formalizing things. Psychology, on the other hand, is an empirical science where a professional works with the black box of your mind; nobody has an exact idea of what is happening inside, you just see the input and predict the output. Itâ€™s more experimental, rather than formal. In computer science, however, things must be broken down to the actual algorithm in order to program them. This process of structuring and formalizing helps psychologists because they can understand the missing pieces of a puzzle, and this is not just my opinion. Psychologists in the field also acknowledge that affective computing helps them. In general, this is a two-way process where both, the psychologists and computer scientists, work together and contribute to research.Evita: I understand now why psychologists need you. What is the benefit then for computer science from researching something so unpredictable as human emotions?MÄra: There are actually quite a few benefits. To begin with, human beings are the ones who work with computers, so it is beneficial if a computer understands the emotions of the user, for example, that the person is frustrated or angry. This is especially true for the generation that hasnâ€™t grown up with computers. Additionally, giving computers the ability to understand emotions has several other benefits including user emotion regulation. For example, we can use a computer program for therapy; in this case, it needs to show emotions that are personalized for this specific human user, and we need to keep a user in a certain emotional state. When developing intelligent tutoring systems, with which my colleagues work, they want a student to be engaged and happy. Therefore, a system needs to detect and understand emotions in order to create an impact.There are also futuristic things like workplace simulation. For example, you have three open offices in your company. You hire a new worker and need to decide which of the three offices is best for her/him in order to maximize their productivity. Emotions are also closely related to productivity, so you can run a series of simulations and find an optimal seating space for the new employee.Evita: With any technology there are opportunities, but also risks that it will be used in for bad purposes. You are researching a very powerful tool that will give the ability to understand and influence peopleâ€™s emotions. For instance, in China, they already have behavioral scoring and applications for recognition of peopleâ€™s biometric data. Does it concern you that your applications can be used not only in a good but also negative way?MÄra: We are definitely not China, so we are definitely not going to monitor everything, we work in a different regulatory environment. In terms of the benefits, however, when it comes to big events where there are crowds of people, I definitely see an advantage in the ability to identify a conflict before it occurs and turns into violence and stop it. Can this be abused?Yes, there is no doubt in my mind that someone will imagine how to use it for bad purposes, there are always people like that (for instance, scientists who discovered nuclear energy didnâ€™t mean it to be used for destruction, they just saw it could be used as a powerful energy source), but then you can either stop progress at all because of fear that someone might abuse it or you just keep doing it.I am a firm believer though that there will be many good things that will come out of applying new technology. Imagine people that have temporary or lifetime disabilities or elderly people having access to assisted living environments that can support their lives, dial a doctor or nurse in case their blood pressure drops or remind to drink medicine. Moreover, when it comes to psychological problems, itâ€™s very nice to have a humanized worker and not just a robot, so that a user can develop a sense of companionship, even friendship with this being. I believe in this case there is good potential for the applications in emotions. Feeling of friendship is extremely important, and we simply cannot create such applications without emotions.Evita: This sounds very beneficial, but what about this scenario: what if people will start preferring communication with such artificial assistants because they will be more predictable and more accessible?MÄra: In general, yes, we want people to have friends, but the problem is that many people donâ€™t have them. Whatâ€™s better, to have an artificial friend or a very small to no chance of finding somebody and staying alone? Keep in mind, I donâ€™t mean for this application to be a substitute for a relationship, it should be an add-on.Evita: Why did you decide to study computer science?MÄra: I was interested in mathematics and I also enjoy physics. In general, logical way of thinking appeals to me. I was also good at languages, but engineering interested me more, so after finishing high school I applied for computer science. To be honest, I had no idea what I was getting into. High schools didnâ€™t teach programming, so I was thinking that I would study advanced Excel or something like that. Luckily, this turned out to be much more interesting and diverse and I really love it here.In general, it seems that people have a very different perception of engineering compared to what it really is. We have students coming here with the idea that they will be developing games; they are very disappointed to learn that it doesnâ€™t happen in the first year. Others come with the idea that they already know everything, but quickly understand that there are many more things for them to learn. I donâ€™t encourage everybody to go into engineering if you seriously donâ€™t like mathematics or even more â€” have a logical way of thinking its going to be very hard for you. At the same time, I often see that people are afraid to go into engineering studies because they underestimate their logical thinking abilities. My advice is â€” if you do think logically and have at least some liking of mathematics, an engineering degree is a great investment no matter what you choose to do in the future.What I can definitely say, is that Riga Technical University is a great place to study and to work especially in regard to computer science. We also have a foreign program here and an excellent curriculum.Riga TechGirls#AI #artificialintelligence #emotionalintelligence #womeninscience----1Educating and inspiring girls & women about technology.

That burden is now on the shoulders of the excellent Cloud Orbit and Cloud Orbit S, priced around the $300 mark.Gaming headsets have continued to pursue many different price points, but the $200 mark is still largely untouched, and Bluetooth support still isnâ€™t that widespread.Style headphones are most commonly priced at $300 or more, and even budget manufacturer Skullcandy has launched both the Crusher 360 and Crusher ANC at premium prices, somewhat ignoring the lower-end market that built their brand.For my latest take on the Cloud MIX, click here.Below, the showdown gauntlet begins. First, a collection of various competing headsets and then direct comparisons to some of HyperXâ€™s own lineup.You can click the included links near the names of the other headsets to see my full review where applicable.Iâ€™ve been a fan of the Arctis lineup since it launched a few years ago. It brought in a whole new take on headset design, speaker drivers and tuning that trickled down from a more expensive pair, and good value for the price.The Arctis 3 Bluetooth offers an astounding number of features for its low $99 price. It has both wired and Bluetooth connection modes, just like the MIX. And unlike HyperXâ€™s model, the Steelseries pair will play back both the wired and Bluetooth audio simultaneously.Unlike the MIX, which features AptX and AAC, the codec situation in the Steelseries camp is super basic, with the Arctis 3 offering only standard SBC support.The build quality of the Arctis 3 also isnâ€™t as nice, with a broader use of plastic, a suspension headband design that might not be to everyoneâ€™s taste, and less memory foam used overall.The Cloud MIX comes in at an undeniable price premium, and hopes its sleeker design, better codec support, and additional comfort will be enough to entice you. The included accessories package is nicer on the MIX, with good braided cables that wonâ€™t kink.The MIX is also better for those that love a deep, accurate bass response, while the Arctis has a brighter profile overall.I love getting a good deal, and itâ€™s hard to outright say that you should spend $199 for the MIX instead of $99 for the Arctis 3 Bluetooth. Theyâ€™re both good for different reasons.The MIX is unquestionably better looking, and uses more premium materials, and it is definitely an upgrade all around in terms of luxury feel, but the lack of dual connection support might be a dealbreaker for your particular use case.The Arctis 3â€™s battery also manages a little more playback time, rated at 24 hours compared to 20 on the MIXâ€¦But the Arctis 3 isnâ€™t as portable or light as the MIX, and doesnâ€™t really look like a style headphone at all. So itâ€™s going to be a bit of a toss-up depending on your personal tastes and whether or not your Bluetooth device supports AptX.Winner: Arctis 3 for pure value, Cloud MIX if you need the most style and portability, and are concerned about codec support.Youâ€™ll have to step all the way up to the $329 Arctis Pro Wireless if you want an Arctis Pro model with Bluetooth support, and just like the cheaper Arctis 3 Bluetooth, it only supports SBC.The Arctis Pro brings its build quality and comfort more in line with the Cloud MIX, with more metal used in the headband and thicker ear pads.Sound-wise, the Arctis Pro is more balanced/flat than the Cloud MIX, which is slightly warmer and more â€œfunâ€ to listen to.Some users donâ€™t like the self-noise that the Arctis Pro Wireless produces, and indeed I can hear a tiny bit of white noise/hissing when theyâ€™re powered on. Self-powered headphones often exhibit some kind of noise, but the floor for that sound on the Cloud MIX is lower, so it wonâ€™t be as much of an issue.The Cloud MIX is much less bulky than the Arctis Pro, and easier to carry around. Its 20 hour battery lasts longer than the 10 hour swappable batteries in the Arctis Pro.Winner: The Cloud MIX is a better Bluetooth headphone, no question.The build quality of the Cloud MIX is comically better than the all-plastic build of the $149 Stealth 700, and if youâ€™re hard on your gear, the extra money is absolutely worth it.I really wish my Stealth 700 hadnâ€™t shipped with a broken adjustment frame. The features package is great, with Active Noise Cancelling, SBC Bluetooth connection, a Wi-Fi Direct connection to the console on the Xbox One version, and multiple EQ presets.But the Cloud MIX is more comfortable, with properly thick ear pads and better noise isolation.A Stealth 700 with a metal headband would be a serious competitor for the Cloud MIX, and Turtle Beach should probably consider putting this feature set inside their Elite Atlas frame. They did recently launch the Elite Atlas Aero, a $149 model I hope to look at sometime soon, but although it features WavesNX 3D audio, it doesnâ€™t match the Cloud MIXâ€™s Bluetooth support.HyperX undeniably wins at every price point on design and build compared to Turtle Beach, and I donâ€™t see that changing any time soon. The Cloud MIX looks like a real style headphone, and the Turtle Beach model is toy-like by comparison.Winner: Cloud MIX on style, build, and sound qualityI know that HyperX likes to market the Cloud MIX as a gaming headset that also happens to convert into a Bluetooth style headphone, and thatâ€™s fine.With the new Rose Gold color on the market, it reads to me more as a mobile style headphone first that also happens to contain an entire Cloud Alpha inside its shrunk-down frame.Against other Bluetooth non-gaming products in the $200 range, it does very well.Itâ€™s more sleek and portable than the M50XBT(Review), and its warm sound is right in line with typical consumer tunings. Itâ€™s better-built than Skullcandyâ€™s newest offerings. It doesnâ€™t have the noise cancelling of the Sony WH-CH700N(Review), but it has comparable audio quality and better materials in the frame.Best Buy could shelve the Cloud MIX next to other $200 Bluetooth headphones and I wouldnâ€™t bat an eye.It stands toe-to-toe with many of them, and has exactly the right feature set for that sort of product. That it also happens to contain a nice wired gaming headset is just icing on the cake.If youâ€™re primarily a mobile phone/laptop listener looking for a good, small, stylish Bluetooth headphone, the Cloud MIX is a great choice.The Cloud MIXâ€™s wired gaming headset mode is essentially, feature-for-feature, identical to the $99 Cloud Alpha.The $100 price disparity between the Alpha and the MIX is the major reason that reviewers questioned the price point of the Bluetooth version a year ago, myself included.On the surface, it seems weird to pay $100 more for a sleeker Alpha that also has Bluetooth support.But from a different perspective, you could say â€œWell, they spent a lot of engineering time to replicate the Alphaâ€™s performance in a smaller, optionally wireless package thatâ€™s still comfortable. Itâ€™s more stylish. Itâ€™s more portable. Itâ€™s much lighter. And it offers good modern codec support.â€ All of these things are true.Whether those things are worth $100 or not is the tricky thing, and I think thatâ€™s up to each personâ€™s tastes to answer. I canâ€™t jump inside your head to figure out how you use your gear.If youâ€™re mainly after a wired gaming headset, the Alpha is the clear choice. Its larger pads will fit more heads better (though I have no issues with fit on the MIX), and its price point is still very compelling years after release.Both headsets sound largely the same, with the Cloud MIX offering just a touch more bass thatâ€™s good for portable use scenarios. Both have a similar microphone. And both use the same detachable cable system, so if you end up owning both you can swap the cables if you need to for some reason.If youâ€™re frequently using your headset on the go, the lighter frame of the Cloud MIX might make it worth the premium it to you, whether you go wired or wireless.Itâ€™s the most â€œcloudyâ€ of the entire family, and I think thatâ€™s more of a strength than a lot of folks gave it credit for last year. Myself included.Winner: Cloud Alpha for those that donâ€™t plan to use Bluetooth extensivelyThis is an even tougher choice than the one above. The $130 Cloud Alpha S is incredibly compelling, featuring improved comfort over the original model, fun bass adjustment sliders, and a new surround dongle that features a new original surround system from HyperX.These are targeting two different sorts of users. Do you use your headphones out and about a lot, but also game at home? Then the Cloud MIXâ€™s light weight, style, and Bluetooth make it a better choice.Are you a fan of bass and virtual surround sound who primarily games at home? Then the Cloud Alpha S is a wonderful choice, and you wonâ€™t mind its criminally short cable as much.If HyperX were to launch a â€œpremiumâ€ version of the Cloud MIX (maybe called the Cloud MIX S?) in a new series of fun colors in the future, with a built-in EQ using the existing amp circuitry, and they also included the surround dongle from the Alpha Sâ€¦Iâ€™d personally buy one immediately.Winner: Cloud Alpha S for home users, Cloud MIX for frequent portable users.If your aim is to game wirelessly, the Cloud Flight is a better choice than the MIX thanks to its 2.4ghz receiver.Bluetooth, even when paired with the AptX Low Latency codec, has never been the absolute best choice for gaming. For the most immersive gamplay, you want the sound to get to your ears as fast as possible, and the receiver on the Flight does a great job of that.The Flight also has a more balanced sound profile than the warmer Cloud MIX. Thatâ€™s not at all a slight against the sound quality of the MIX, but if youâ€™re a real detail-hound or youâ€™re not as into hard-hitting bass, the Cloud Flight will probably sound better to you.As far as portable use goes, the Cloud MIXâ€™s small frame still takes the win, just like in every other comparison here. The Flightâ€™s ear cups rotate flat, but donâ€™t collapse, and itâ€™s almost as bulky as the Cloud Orbit.The only thing that frustrates me to this day about the Cloud Flight is that the microphone doesnâ€™t work in the optional wired mode, meaning that you can only use the mic on a PS4 or PC with the wireless connection.The Cloud MIX has no such mic problems, allowing you to use its boom mic in both wired and Bluetooth mode, and including a second microphone built in to the ear cup if you need to take a call without the boom.Winner: Cloud Flight for audiophiles and the lag-sensitive, Cloud MIX for Xbox gamers that want to use a mic. :)Save for lack of Bluetooth support, the ~$300 Cloud Orbit is better in almost every way than the Cloud MIX.As it should be!The Orbit sounds better thanks to its planar drivers, offers a variety of EQ modes, has better ear pads, and has full 3D sound thanks to WavesNX support.Its only â€œfailings,â€ as far is this comparison is concerned, are in the design and build departments. The Orbit is a bulkier headset with more plastic used in its frame, and itâ€™s not as portable-friendly as the MIX.Still, the Orbit is a true flagship gaming product, taking that mantle away from the MIX and allowing it to instead be HyperXâ€™s fun, compact Beats competitor.Winner: Cloud OrbitStyle, portability, and design matter in headphones. This is a thing youâ€™re going to touch all the time, and put on your head.In that area, the Cloud MIX really shines. Itâ€™s built from solid materials. Itâ€™s stylish. Itâ€™s small and light, and very comfortable to wear for long sessions.Itâ€™s not as cheap as some other gaming products. It doesnâ€™t offer a dedicated 2.4ghz gaming connection. It doesnâ€™t include extra ear pads or a surround dongle.But it holds its own against other comparably-priced Bluetooth headphones, and contains the performance of the Cloud Alpha, a well-regarded gaming headset, within a more compact frame.When it first launched and was inadvertently HyperXâ€™s new flagship, I didnâ€™t get it.It didnâ€™t offer the same sort of value as other HyperX products, and seemed almost like a spin-off from the family.Now, itâ€™s no longer the top-end product in the line, and no one else in the gaming headset space offers this level of performance in such a tiny frame.If youâ€™re looking for a stylish Bluetooth headphone to use with your phone and laptop, and youâ€™re also a console or PC gamer, then the Cloud MIX is a wonderful choice. It sits right between those two market segments, and as such somewhat defies the traditional apples-to-apples comparisons so common in gaming headset reviews.Purely as a gaming headset, it falters a little bit on raw value compared to the cheaper Alpha. But considered as a portable style headphone it wins those points back.----1I write independent game reviews and commentary.

The stereo playing the beat laid on the bed next to the mic stand and I remember freestyling about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. It was 2006 and the business of music was entirely different. Limewire was still the beast it was and I spent most of my middle school days online sharing my music on Bebo & Myspace with SoundClick players and YouTube videos. Feel old yet or were you even around then?Todayâ€™s climate of distribution and consumption has evolved well beyond pirating music via torrent software. Much like the transitions from cassette to CD, CD to mp3 and now mp3 to streaming, we are currently living in the next transition, immersive technology and decentralized music blockchain platforms. But what doest that mean and how can the industry, the artists and the various stakeholders stay ahead of the curve?By 2021, virtual & augmented reality, cryptocurrency and other blockchain technology is expected to make waves into the mainstream. A treasured experience of traveling to a record store and playing that brand new CD in your car will change to paying musicians in crypto and receiving access to a virtual reality album release party. Every time a transition occurs as a byproduct of technology, the industry canâ€™t keep up and a window opens for artists to take back more control. And as technology becomes readily accessible to consumers and market developers, the idea of independents disrupting is a greater possibility. But with anything, a financial investment is required to convert noise into purposeful attention. But this is were the new artist development walks in.As the industry adapts to the changes of technology, artists have the greatest opportunity to retain ownership and rights in how their intellectual property is exploited. Gone are the days of middlemen controlling the logistics of how your works can be distributed and consumed. We live in an era were creatives get to explore, innovate and add their contribution to culture. Musicians have the ability to segment current and potential fans and tailor experiences for those segmented audiences.

According to famous management gurus Van Fleet and Peterson, management can be defined as â€˜a set of activities directed at the efficient and effective utilization of resources in the pursuit of one or more goalsâ€™ (managementstudyhq, 2019).otopark has been incepted on the principles of efficient resource management (ERM). It aims to manage all the possible parking inventories available through cooperation and collaboration. Through our primary and secondary research, we found that the problem of parking arises due to two main reasons:According to Hindustan Times, twenty-five parking lots across the city, that could altogether accommodate approximately 2,100 cars, lie unused and vacant because the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has failed to find bidders to maintain these spaces (Hindustan Times, 2018). The example alone clearly explains the first reason of parking crisis, that is, the highly inefficient management of existing parking resources.The lack of visibility or awareness about existing parking infrastructure is also another reason for growing parking crisis. Civilians are not aware of the available parking options and end up parking on the road side illegally, causing tension not only to the individual but also to the surrounding residents. This illegal parking causes issues like encroachment, which is highly undesirable for the community. Proper visibility of parking spaces through any medium will be highly helpful for vehicle owners who need the parking space.According to Times of India, the current demand for parking in Mumbai is 284,000 against 70,000 available spaces â€” this means for every 4 parking spots in demand, only 1 is available. It is estimated that the demand for parking will rise to 537,000 by 2034 (Mumbai Mirror, 2018). Demand for parking will only continue to rise, but the supply will not be able to match the demand with existing solutions. To directly address the impending problems, otopark is solving the problems of insufficient or inadequate parking supply while also bringing about a positive change in current inefficiencies in the parking system. By collaborating with private parking owners like co-operative housing societies, hospitals, restaurants etc., otopark will be able to manage the better resource allocation of parking supply.In terms of increasing the efficiency of current parking resources, otoparkâ€™s disruptive business model collaborates with existing parking contractors and private parking lot owners to make them understand about the innovation in current parking trends and also educating them about new technologies enable for a robust parking sharing economy. otopark also helps parking lot owners to manage their parking space efficiently, resulting in an improved and efficient parking ecosystem.otoparkâ€™s disruptive business model is based on the Shared Value principle wherein value is created at all levels and to all the stakeholders. We will discuss about otoparkâ€™s disruptive business model and technology in our next post.Till then stay tuned and donâ€™t forget to follow us on (@myotopark) Facebook, Instagram, Twitter & LinkedIn for the latest updates.Namasteâ€¦!----otoparkotopark connects people looking for parking with hosts who have parking space to shareotoparkinotopark--otoparkinotopark--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Scott H.

It seems that throughout history, the changes have always been recoverable. Human nature requires our ability to adapt. Our ability to adapt as individuals and as a collective society has been proven over our species existence.Even within my own lifetime, technological advancements have been happening rather quickly. Amazingly, technology has managed to already replace 90% of jobs that humans used to do. All indications point towards the fact that automation will increasingly replace more and more jobs. American college graduates have increasingly become enslaved to their debts. 44.7 million borrowers owe $1.56 trillion in student loans. This fact is problematic in and of itself.Noam Chomsky articulates the real problem to be found in regards to the insane levels of debt that college graduates now are faced with.â€œStudents who acquire large debts putting themselves through school are unlikely to think about changing society. When you trap people in a system of debt, they canâ€™t afford the time to think. Tuition fee increases are a â€œdisciplinary technique,â€ and, by the time students graduate, they are not only loaded with debt, but have also internalized the â€œdisciplinarian culture.â€ This makes them efficient components of the consumer economy.â€ â€” Noam ChomskyThe growing student loan debt problem is a crisis in and of itself.A study conducted by McKinsey, reported that more than a fifth of the worldâ€™s labor force will lose their jobs to automation by 2030. Quite an alarming conclusion.One fifth of the worldâ€™s labor force would equate to around 800 million people. McKinsey reviewed 800 job types across 46 nations. More specifically, McKinsey stated that we can expect one-third of American workers to lose their jobs to automation by 2030.Upon reading this study, my first instinct was that various industries and countries would be hit harder than others. That seems to be true from what I can deduct. The one aspect that remains consistent is that both developed and emerging economies will be affected. It presents difficulties for both types of economies in highly different ways. Like any economic revolution, it can also present opportunities in emerging and developed economies. But this will only happen, if these economies are to react fast enough.Most Americans are aware of the fact that automation is coming down the pipeline. However, most Americans do not realize that we are already in the thick of it, to a certain extent. Americaâ€™s labor participation rate is only 62.7%. The U.S. labor participation rate is more comparable to nations like El Salvador (61.9%) and Colombia (62.4%) then countries like the United Kingdom (79.3%), France (72.4%), Netherlands (69.7%), and Switzerland (67.8%).While the low labor participation rate can partly be explained by the Baby Boomers retiring or children in school, this does not fully encapsulate the true picture. As of 2016, the United States had lost 5 million manufacturing jobs not to bad trade deals and outsourcing, but rather technology. A study from Ball State University found that 13% of manufacturing jobs have been lost to trade while 88% have been lost to robots and other technological advancements.One would expect to see a decrease in manufacturing output correlate with this, right? Actually, the opposite has occurred. The study found that from 2006 to 2013, â€œmanufacturing grew by 17.6%, or at roughly 2.2% per year.â€While the output increased, 5 million American workers became displaced in the process. This is the trend we increasingly see. McKinsey expects the United States to lose another 73 million jobs in a similar fashion. From 2003 to 2013, white, middle-aged suicide increased 40%. A rapidly changing and displacing economy is at the forefront of the blame. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention claims suicide rates now top the number of deaths due to automobile accidents. The problem has become so severe that life expectancy in the United States has now decreased for three consecutive years.One has to wonder just how bad things will become as increasingly more workers become displaced throughout the economy. Those who understand the problems associated with low labor participation rates would expect to see higher toxic drug use, increased crime rates, increased suicide rates, the rise of extremist and hate groups, xenophobia and a host of other issues. Arguably, a lot of these factors are already showing face.Automation is now going beyond just the realms of manufacturing. McKinsey points out that there is high potential for automation to transform sectors such as healthcare and finance. Robots are already assisting doctors in performing surgeries.The Mayo Clinic states the many advantages to be found by robots performing surgeries include:Both the healthcare and finance sectors involve highly knowledge based application. It was once thought that these industries were safe from automation due to the amount of knowledge that is required. We can now see that is the precise reason why automation now poses such a large threat to them. Machine learning and robotics has an extremely large capability to impact any job that is largely based upon knowledge and use thereof.The McKinsey study points out that one-third of tasks could be automated in 60% of jobs. Given this statistic, we can expect massive changes would need to take place for both employers and workers. This statistic that McKinsey references is using only technologies that are available as of July 2016. It is easy to see how that number will drastically change as new technologies are brought forward.Who is most at risk to be replaced by automation? McKinsey looked at occupations and activities and classified whether or not there is technically feasible for automation. And as they point out, each occupation is made up of various activities. Each of these activities have varying levels of technical feasibility.To paint this example, I will use retailing. In retailing there are various activities like collecting and processing data, interacting with customers, and setting up merchandise displays. Each of these activities are going to have various levels of automation potential. Due to that, McKinsey arrives at an overall estimate based on scores for the whole.In addition to technical feasibility, McKinsey states four other factors that will impact automation.If we review the graph above, we see that McKinsey has broken down activities into several categories. They then ranked these based upon the amount of time being spent on activities that can be automated by adapting current technologies. By studying all occupations in the US, we can see patterns of where time is being spent in all US occupations.It seems that those that have the largest percentages of time being spent on them, are many times those that are most susceptible to being replaced by automation. Data collection, data processing, and predictable physical work account for 51% of all time being spent in US occupations.Over half of the time being spent in all US occupations is highly susceptible to being replaced by automation, as classified by McKinsey.To which sectors does automation pose the biggest threat? This is naturally a very important question. McKinsey slates manufacturing, food service and accommodations, and retailing as the top of the most susceptible list. In the food service and accommodations sector, 73% of the activities performed by workers have potential for automation replacement. In the manufacturing sector, the number is 59%. In the retailing sector, 53% of all activities are automatable. Of course, across all of these sectors, specific occupations will differ as to how susceptible they are.As I just mentioned, even within these sectors, there are other considerations to be had. Bookkeepers, accountants, auditing clerks, all require specific sets of skills and levels of training. These occupations have greater scarcity than basic cooks or dishwashers, for example. But on the other hand, the activities that accountants perform cost less to automate. A company would need to invest in mostly software and computers to replace that job.As it stands currently, McKinsey is able to show that automation for activities within middle-skill jobs (for example data collection or data processing) have led to an â€œobserved tendency for higher rates of automation.â€You may be breathing easier after reading that if you have a higher skill job, but consider this. McKinsey is using data as it currently stands for automation. Automation is only going to advance in its capabilities. Because of this, they state, â€œjobs involving higher skills will probably be automated at increasingly high rates.â€Where does your occupation fit in? View the graph below:Largely, I have been discussing job activities that you may believe to not require high levels of education. With the exception of auditing and accounting, that is correct. However, consider the fact that one third of all time spent in occupations in the US economy involves the collection and processing of data. These activities are not done just by entry-level workers or low-wage receiving workers. Those who have an annual income of higher than $200,000 spend 31% of their time performing these tasks. This just continues to paint the ever broad picture of how disruptive automation will become at all levels of occupations.McKinsey uses an example I really like within the financial services and insurance sectors. The finance world relies on professional expertise. In order for stock traders and investment bankers to be successful, they must have a certain level of expertise and skill. Regardless, it is true that half the time spent in the fields of finance and insurance is spent collecting and processing data. We already know that the potential for automation in those activities is very high.For example, insurance sales agents are responsible for gathering customer or product information. That information is then passed to underwriters where they verify the accuracy of the information the sales agent collected. As for the financial world, bank tellers verify the accuracy of financial data. 43% of the financials sectors workerâ€™s time spent could be potentially automated. And once again, it is going to vary depending upon specific occupation.I have detailed many sectors that have a high or middle range potential for automation. While this is certainly important, it would be rather pointless if we donâ€™t identify which sectors or occupations have the least potential for automation.McKinsey states that the hardest activities to currently automate are those that involve: managing and developing people (9% automation potential) and applying expertise to decision making, planning, or creative work (18% potential for automation).The activities can be extremely varied. They can include: coding software, creating menus, or designing promotional materials. Computers are able to perform excellent work when they have well defined parameters. But they do not do well at creating goals, and specific works of art as it currently stands. Sectors where human interaction is highly needed tends to have low potential for automation. Two sectors that McKinsey cites as such are: education and healthcare.McKinsey also points out that within these sectors, there is still high potential for automation. Take for example, nursing assistants, who spend about two-thirds of their time collecting health information. What about doctors? Some of the more complex functions that doctors performed could become automated. Two of these examples include reading radiological scans or administering anesthesia. Keep in mind, the list is going to continue to grow as automation increasingly becomes more capable.McKinsey believes that the technical feasibility of automation is actually lowest in the in the education sector. While digital technology is changing the field, it still requires expertise on the part of teachers. But where McKinsey does see the potential for automation within the sector happens largely outside of the classroom. Administration, janitors and cleaners, and cooks in cafeterias are all places where automation could cause disruption and displacement. The automation of administration processes could help to reduce the cost of education.As with all important issues, it is first important to come to understand the facts and data. That is what I desired to do with part one of this article mini series. Once we come to face the facts, then we can better make decisions about how to proceed forward. Part two will focus on possible ways of how to move forward into the automation age.----1I am a vocalist, writer, entrepreneur, and bodybuilder.

Absolutely.Startups arenâ€™t the result of founders alone, it takes an economy and economies can be modeled. Now, can they be timed and predicted? Can we learn from the past to better innovate in the future?The goal in Venture Capital, by way of technology, is â€œto rapidly create new giant technology companies that could lead in brand new, high growth categories. Ride-sharing (Lyft & Uber) , work-space sharing (WeWork) , food-delivery (UberEtas, Deliveroo, Doordash) , couch-sharing (Airbnb) you name it. The promise has been that these technology giants can approach the size, scale, reach, and ultimately, market capitalization of the FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google), and Alibaba/Tencent.â€That, a thought from Vitruvian Medical Deviceâ€™s CEO Vinod Mahendroo, affirms a point that many working in Venture Capital frequently reiterate, that the development of Companies the likes of which go public, or substantially exit through acquisition, is not the same as IP commercialization, new business development, R&D, nor most startup development.Venture Capital investment by design and intention, seeks out the development of â€œCompaniesâ€ (Corporations as legal entities) wherein Innovation and Marketing are paramount.Thus the trends are rather straightforward to model and even predict because such companies are NOT the result of founders alone.Such startups take about 7 years to start exiting.The last economic bust was in 2009/2010When that happens, as it recurringly does and will againâ€¦People look instead for work. Investors slow high risk investment.We like to perceive that startups and founders alone are the catalyst of venture development.Thatâ€™s not remotely true.You get the idea.What caused the recent surge, and will again cause the next surge, of tech companies going public?Little more than timing.If we as a society want to perpetuate that, and soften the busts, and booms, so as to more regularly have innovative new companies putting people to work, it starts with appreciating the impact of economic policy and ensuring our government (whichever party is in office) makes it easier for everyone to take the risk involved in starting something new.Weâ€™ll bust again at some point. Our present enthusiasm for startups and debate of venture capital will wane; just as it did in â€™09â€¦ and 2001â€¦ and before that, and then 7â€“10 years later someone will again be asking this question.----CEO of MediaTech Ventures, CMO to #VC, #Startup Advisor.

From our smartphones to televisions to thermostats to doorbells, technology is all around us and it is here to stay. While technology certainly has incredible benefits to society in plenty of ways, I am going to use this essay to focus on the negative aspect of technology. You could write an equally persuasive essay on why technology is beneficial and why we as a society should champion it more than we currently do, however I am going to spend my time writing about the downsides of said technology.I find technology to be sort of an ever-growing and all powerful being. It has a stranglehold on nearly every aspect of our lives, and seems to be expanding further and further to infect more and more of our lives. I grew up with the explosion of technology. I canâ€™t really remember a time where technology wasnâ€™t a big part of my life, however, I can say that I have noticed differences within myself as well as those around me as a direct consequence of technology. The majority of the technology that I interacted with growing up was almost always centered around video games. From the Gameboy to the GameCube to the PSP, my fondest and most frequent memories were around playing video games with my friends or alone at my house. I have nothing bad to say about those times. They were fun and immersive. Did I spend too much time playing these games? Probably, yet these video game episodes didnâ€™t take away from other extracurricular activities that I also enjoyed such as sports or playing an instrument. That distinction is important in my eyes. The technology in this case did not take away from activities that promoted thought and exercise and social skills that are necessary (in my view) to better function in society (we can save the discussion over our flawed society for another time).On the flip side, as I grew older, technology certainly interfered with social situations. The decrease in social interactions and experiences came about as a direct result of the rise of the personal smartphone. The phones we have today consume and stimulate us to seemingly no end. You can scroll through Instagram and then 10 seconds later scroll through again. Not because you are necessarily interested in seeing if anything new has popped up, but rather because our attention spans have been shortened so much and we need to be stimulated now more than ever. The simple act of scrolling through an app or even looking at your phone is enough in some cases. In a study conducted in the UK, 41% of the participants said they had two or more phones to make sure they stayed connected.[1]That is a ridiculous statement to make. For the vast majority of people there is absolutely no reason to own two phones. That would be like owning two toasters or two mailboxes. Sure there are some people that need two phones to balance work and personal, yet the desire to stay connected with the social sphere has become so strong that 40% of responses say they had at least two phones.We feel detached and naked without our phones and this addiction is not only becoming worse but also now starting at an improbably young age. According to a report by Common Sense Media, in 2011, 10 percent of kids under age 2 used a mobile device, that number in 2017 was 38 percent.[2]This dramatic rise can probably be attributed to accessibility as smartphones and tablets are becoming cheaper and cheaper. Instead of having to pay for afterschool care, a parent can purchase a tablet for their kids to occupy themselves with. While this is certainly not the worst thing, as it gives many parents the freedom they need to support their families, the lack of communication and reliance on a smart device is not a path we should strive for.Furthermore, a study conducted by FCD Educational Services found those who use too much technology are more likely to develop the same brain chemistry as substance abusers.[3]Lee Essig, a psychology graduate student at BYU said, â€œThis instant gratification we seek may initially be motivated by a desire for pleasure, but once our brain has learned where we turn for pleasure, it will begin to use the same neural pathways as a response to pain, fear, anger, sadness.â€[4]There is a massive stigma against drugs and those associated with drugs in our society today, yet there is not nearly the same uproar over someone using technology even though it has been proven that certain tendencies arise from this overuse. Of course the two are not equivalent, but I do find it interesting that we as a society have almost completely ignored the dangers of technology. â€œInstead of a kid coming home and interacting with people, they hop on an electronic device, and that is a real challenge,â€ Johnson said. â€œWith good media, there is also bad media, so finding the balance to let them enjoy it and grow from those things is hard.â€[5]A study into the cell-phone addiction among college students aimed to investigate â€œpossibly the biggest non-drug addiction of the 21st century.â€ The researchers found â€œthat college students spent nearly nine hours daily on their cell-phones. As the functionality of cell-phones continues to expand, addiction to this seemingly indispensable piece of technology becomes an increasingly realistic possibility.â€ They have not found the â€œtipping pointâ€ as they call it, the line between helpful and harmful phone usage, however they believe that that point might be closer than we realize.[6]It is important to discuss the counterargument to my claims that smartphones are the main harm to our youth. ANew York Times article by Tracy Dennis-Tiwary claims that anxiety has been increasing in teenagers for quite some time and that it is the anxiety that is driving the youth. â€œWhen weâ€™re anxious, we gravitate toward experiences that dull the present anxious moment. Enter mobile devices, the perfect escape into a two-dimensional half-life, one that teenagers can make sense of.â€[7]I understand what she is saying, yet I think the smartphones are to blame. Smartphones have become such a staple in our everyday lives that I think it is naÃ¯ve to exclude them from the conversation and say they are not to blame. Personally I think smartphones and social media can cause tremendous amounts of anxiety, rather than being a safe haven. Dennis-Tiwary concludes by saying that â€œwe should devote resources to making smartphones less addictive, but we should devote even more resources to addressing the public health crisis of anxiety that is causing teenagers so much suffering and driving them to seek relief in the ultimate escape machines.â€Technology today is so versatile that it is important for parents to be able to have control over what their kids are able to do on the devices. Companies are now implementing time limits and parental locks that allow parents to set guidelines and rules for their kids to follow even when they are not around. This is a good start but there are still workarounds and other ways to access the more destructive forms of technology that is easier to consume. As a result, parents having seemingly no choice but to let their children consume media via technology. The kids now â€œtext instead of call, or text instead of talking in person. The technology we now have is ruining our childrenâ€™s communication and socialization skills.â€[8]A whopping 75% of teenagers own cell phones and children, ages 8â€“18, spend over 7.5 hours a day, 7 days a week using media sites outside of school.[9]The problems that arise from such an overuse of technology stem further than the addictive nature we discussed earlier, as communication and an understanding of how humans communicate is hampered. â€œNon-verbal communication is an important part of communicatingâ€¦Understanding the non-verbal aspects of communication is crucial because social situations we need to modify our behavior in response to the reactions of others.â€[10]I believe that I was part of the last age group to semi-successfully learn how to communicate face to face, although I can feel my skills declining almost daily. It is rare for me to go out to dinner with my friends without everyone staring at their phone for the majority of the dinner. These are my friends for goodness sake, you would think we would be able to talk to each other and hold a conversation for over an hour. The most damning part of all of this is that for the most part none of us are really doing anything on our phones. We are just opening and closing apps and scrolling mindlessly through them. No one is reading a stimulating article or book or anything of the sorts during this time. Phones and technology as a whole have taken away our ability to communicate with anything other than them (phones). When texting with another person it doesnâ€™t even feel real anymore. You go through the motions, tap your fingers around on the screen and then you move on to the next. There is no semblance of personal feel to anything surrounding texting. â€œWhile technology makes life easier for people, it also creates some problems for our society such as the decline in ordinary social behaviors.â€[11]The argument could be made that emojis help convey the attitudes of people online, but I would counter that many emojis mean different things to different people. Someone could send an emoji and it could convey several different meanings, yet without much other context it leads to miscommunication and altogether a diminished sort of communication.Jaron Lanier, author of You Are Not A Gadget, writes that â€œchildren want attentionâ€¦therefore, young adults, in their newly extended childhood, can now perceive themselves to be finally getting enough attention, through social networks and blogs.â€[12]The desire for likes and follows is greater than ever before, but the consequences of such desires are too broad to discuss in this paper. Lanier continues with an excellent connection to the need for children to always be connected. â€œSeparation anxiety is assuaged by constant connection. Young people announce every detail of their lives on services like Twitter not to show off, but to avoid the closed door at bedtime, the empty room, the screaming vacuum of an isolated mind.â€[13]This is another form of addiction, only further leading to the decline and demise of interpersonal communication.I would be remiss if I did not mention Kevin Rooseâ€™s personal anecdote of his battle with his overdependence on his smartphone. In it he talks about how he made an action plan to significantly cut down his usage. From deleting all of the apps that did not give him pleasure, to locking away his phone, to taking 48 hours completely free from his phone, Roose details an impressive and weirdly inspiring tale of how he cut down his daily phone usage from over 5 hours to just over an hour in the span of 30 days. I found his article to be humorous, relatable, and honestly inspiring. After reading the article I challenged myself to do some of the things he did. I deleted several social media apps that did not give me pleasure, I moved the phone to a different room when I was doing work, and I did a small test of 6 hours without using my phone at all. While these things are not that hard or impressive to accomplish, I was very proud of myself for doing them. Afterwards, I found myself to be far more attentive and engaged and aware of my surroundings. I felt a little weight lifted off of my shoulders so to speak as I wasnâ€™t constantly having the urge to check my notifications. It was something that I hope to continue to do in the futureHowever, the underlying problem still persists. We are all too connected to our phones. It saddens me to write this essay. I am guilty of everything I have previously written about. I cope with doing nothing by going on my phone. And then I do it again and again and again. I absorb very little information and I care about what I am consuming even less. It is absolutely an addiction and I would venture to bet the majority of kids feel likewise whether they will admit it or not. Going on your phone is taking the easy way out. Instead of exploring the world through different mediums we constantly check our phones or watch T.V. There are certainly benefits to our phones and technology in general, yet all things need moderation, perhaps none more so than the things that have become almost attached to our bodies.[1]LaMotte, Sandee. â€œSmartphone Addiction Could Be Changing Your Brain.â€ CNN, Cable News Network, 1 Dec. 2017, www.cnn.com/2017/11/30/health/smartphone-addiction-study/index.html.[2]â€Technology May Have Negative Social Effect on Kids.â€ The Daily Universe.

In fact, weâ€™re paying approximately 23 percent less per line today than we were paying in 2008, which should make paying that pesky bill each month a little easier.And yet, many of us continue to feel like weâ€™re overpaying. No matter how â€œaffordableâ€ the wireless carriers try to make their plans, we continue to wish they were cheaper. Fortunately, you donâ€™t have to wait for the carriers to drop their cell phone plans.As it turns out, you can make your monthly wireless plan cheaper right now. These are the seven best ways to lower your cell phone bill in 2019.To keep the cost of your bill as low as possible, keep your current device as long as possible. And if youâ€™re already on an equipment installment plan (EIP), you can reduce the cost of your bill by paying off the remaining balance of your device.According to reports, more and more people are keeping their phones longer. In fact, the average smartphone is nearly three years old by the time itâ€™s replaced with a newer model. Some analysts point to rising prices attached to the latest smartphones, but the fact that instalment plans will raise your monthly cell phone bill is surely another consideration.Before T-Mobile brought back unlimited plans, mobile data was quite expensive. Users who werenâ€™t lucky enough to be â€œgrandfatheredâ€ into truly unlimited data had high-cost, low-cap data buckets forced onto them. With these buckets, each user got an allotment of data, after which any additional data usage incurred overage charges.Fortunately, unlimited data is all but the norm now, which has made unlimited data plans quite affordable by comparison.All major US carriers offer unlimited data right now, and each carrierâ€™s rates for unlimited plans are somewhat comparable. If you have an outdated plan, consider getting a quote for a new plan by visiting one of your carrierâ€™s retail locations. Thereâ€™s a good chance that switching to a new plan will make your bill cheaper.After youâ€™ve gotten rid of EIP and changed your plan, what can you do next? The answer: discounts and promotions.You could be eligible for discounts that you donâ€™t even know about. If youâ€™re in the Armed Forces, for example, most carriers will discount your monthly service plan; while the amount of the discount can vary, 25 percent isnâ€™t uncommon.Similarly, many companies have partnerships with the wireless carriers, allowing their employees to get discounted wireless service. All four of the major US carriers â€” AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile â€” offer such programs; just click on the link that corresponds to your carrier to check eligibility.Two other discounts worth mentioning, and which are very easy to get, are discounts for automatic bill payment and paperless billing. Typically, these discounts range from $5 to $10, depending on the criteria and the number of lines on your account.Finally, many carriers offer promotional plans that are available for a limited time. These plans usually offer the same features as the carrierâ€™s standard plans but at a lower monthly rate. Best of all, once you enroll in a promotional plan, youâ€™re â€œgrandfatheredâ€ into the plan once it goes away, which means the plan cannot be taken from you. Youâ€™ll retain the perks of the plan and its discount until you switch to another plan.It might seem counterproductive to reduce your bill by adding more lines to your account, but hear us out.For a single line of service, the cost of a monthly bill is higher per line than a family plan. The reason for this is because carriers offer reduced rates for additional lines of service. So when you add additional lines to an account, the cost per line actually goes down.For this reason, adding additional lines for family or friends can be a great way to reduce the average cost per line. If each person pays for his or her own line, then youâ€™ll likely end up paying much less than you are for a single-line plan. Of course, this is contingent on the fact that each line doesnâ€™t have additional charges, like an EIP, insurance, and other costs.Wireless service plans donâ€™t usually seem unreasonable when you look at the base price. But after the add-onsMany of the add-ons that people attach to their plans are unnecessary. A prime example would be the enhanced voicemail services that most carriers offer; for many people, the additional cost isnâ€™t warranted by what little real-world value that enhanced voicemail offers.Depending on your device, the protection plan is another add-on that you might consider eliminating, too. Itâ€™s nice to have simply for the peace of mind, but device protection â€” which most people never end up using â€” increases the cost of your monthly bill by $10 or potentially even more.If youâ€™ve paid off your device, changed your plan, applied your discounts, removed the add-ons, and youâ€™re still not happy with the cost of your monthly bill, then itâ€™s time to start shopping other carriers.Changing wireless carriers is a hassle that most people donâ€™t want to deal with, but if you feel like your bill is too high, itâ€™s a good idea to at least see what else is available. At the very least, you can probably use your knowledge of other carriers cell phone plans to negotiate a better rate with your current carrier.When your carrier has done all it can do, switching providers might be one of the only options left. But the good news is that itâ€™s becoming quite commonplace for carriers to offer special rates or promotions for new customers who are transferring from one of their competitors. In fact, both Sprint and T-Mobile have periodic promotions for new customers where theyâ€™ll pay off the remainder of your current EIP. Keep an eye out for such promotions; they may offer you the best opportunity to make your move, especially if you have an EIP on your current plan.Going prepaid is arguably one of the best routes to take if your priority is to save money on your monthly wireless bill. Why? BecauseAT&T, which is considered one of the most expensive of the main US wireless providers, and Cricket Wireless. Currently, AT&Tâ€™s single-line unlimited plan costs $80 per month; if you sign up for autopay and paperless billing that drops to $70 per month within two to three billing cycles.By comparison, Cricket Wireless â€” which runs on AT&Tâ€™s mobile network and, for all intents and purposes, offers indistinguishable coverage â€” offers a nearly identical plan that starts at $55 per month, or $50 after the autopay discount. This is a minimum difference of $20 per month before taking the rising taxes and fees added to postpaid service plans into consideration.This discrepancy can be seen across all the major carriers and their prepaid networks. So if youâ€™re looking to save money on your bill, switching to a prepaid service provider offers the greatest potential for savings.Cell phones have become an essential part of daily life. At any given time, thereâ€™s a good chance that we â€” or the people around us â€” are watching videos, posting on social media, or browsing the web. As long as the cell phone is a central part of our daily lives, weâ€™re going to need wireless service plans.But that doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™re forced to pay high rates. As it turns out, there are many ways to make your cell phone bill more affordable, whether itâ€™s with discounts, unlimited data, or by converting to a family plan.This article was originally published in â€” https://www.getprovider.com/7-ways-to-lower-your-cell-phone-bill-in-2019/Dane is a technology journalist, blogger, and writer based outside of Washington, DC.

On being asked, whether he was happy in life â€” he answered â€œMyhappiness depends on my crops as my family is completely dependent on meand agriculture is my only source of livelihood.â€Naresh prepares the land for sowing the seeds. He buys his seeds and takes thecredit from Arthiya (the middlemen), and completes the sowing process by hiring a few labourers. Naresh doesnâ€™t have money but these men have to be paid timely â€” the expense of which sometimes make him so vulnerable that he has to take more high interest loans, therefore- debt mounts.

I have seen the evolution curve from the days of early programming languages, SDKâ€™s, data cubes, CGI, apache, web scripting, java, p2p etc. Some of these technologies are already relegated to history or have morphed into something unrecognizably new.But, many of the yesteryear technologies (if I am allowed to call it that way) did one thing really well. They seem to empower an individual and gave him/her the choice to do the new and earn their place. In other words, there was a sense of democratization of technology as itâ€™s spread its wings. Armed with the new, one felt and established relevance in the material world while they may still have started to slip away from the metaphysical world. Oneâ€™s heightened state of mind led them to believe in themselves where some felt liberated, some felt included, some felt gratified, some felt they too belong to a sub-culture that bred only success. Well, at least this is what it looked from the outside. Essentially, armed with your new tools, you worked hard for the masters and the masters took good care of you. Well, they made your dreams come true. Almost. As a creator of technology, you also helped the consumers of technology achieve their dreams and so on. It all seemed like a happy place to be in.Fast forward to the current times and the nuevo references in technology have changed drastically and they are digital transformation, chatbots, big data, machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, voice recognition, IOT, voice assistants etc.Of all the new tech today, the fast-emerging poster child called â€œMr.AIâ€ seems to have occupied a large mind space and is establishing its gargantuan presence across many spheres of life. Mr. AIâ€™s Kafkaesque presence is being discussed, debated and attempts are being made to decipher this new thing-in-a-box and is capturing peopleâ€™s interest beyond imagination. Last month, I heard my wifeâ€™s earnest advise to my son â€œYou have to get a degree in AI and you will do well for yourselfâ€. My dad, who is a doctor said â€œWhat is this AI all about? What will the doctors do in the near future?â€. Teachers and Newspapers quote it almost every day. Not knowing what to do about it, Politicians and governments are talking about it and so are the millennials.Here is an interesting fact from a recent survey conducted on organizations by the supercomputer company Cray. 25% of the respondents consider AI to be critical, and another 77% believe it will become critical in the next three years?Really? Who do you think will be the ultimate beneficiaries of this largesse? I will now use my scratch-art to illustrate an over simplified viewpoint.From where I stand, the goal posts in technology are shifting rapidly and could leave behind a very large population exposed, confused and vulnerable. Will the creator be engulfed by his own creation?Loss of jobs, large scale exclusion, schism of societies, absolute redefinition of economic principles, are some points to ponder in days to come. Colossal changes that could soon bear down upon us are already underway in many working societies.As an example, one look at the manufacturing industry can tell tales of stress and duress and workforce reduction seems to be the new norm of an establishment. Countries with extensive workforces (both skilled and unskilled) are being faced with an arduous task of understanding the already complex human to machine relationships. The rules of engagement are being defined by the unknown faces of the future.I would like to bring your attention to another example which is fast changing the landscape of temporary workers across the globe. The Amazon Mechanical Turk â€” AMT (https://www.mturk.com) platform has been in existence for over a decade now and seems to have created slaves to the system by way of its click-workers. The concept of jobs-as-a-service has brought in disruptions in the job seeker market and potentially has taken away many basic rights of many click-workers who get paid very little money for their services. In turn, click-workers are training Mr.AI for pennies.Tech Republicâ€™s story on AMT will give you a glimpse of the new world order to some extent.I think itâ€™s time to pop the question. Are we really creating our own destroyers?Large populations of world have already been debilitated due to the imbalance of power and money in the hands of the few. Large corporations already wield enough power to change the rules of the game in the name of greed, profits and control. Large scale disruptions in lives of the people in bottom sections of the pyramid has led to civil unrest and disharmony.Could Mr.AI multiply these problems manifold OR alleviate the situation at hand? OR Is the Skynet really emerging beyond James Cameronâ€™s imagination?In a true science fiction manner, the new battlefield is being readied by our-kind for our own defeat and possible annihilation. This Mr.AI conundrum needs strong views, plans and participation of the economists, philosophers, humanists, futurists, governments, regulators and may more thinkers to defeat the self-destructive technologist in this new war. The winner of this war could well determine the course of our future.Carl Sagan once said â€œSomewhere, something incredible is waiting to be knownâ€. Well from where I stand today, this something incredible is definitely not the two-letter acronym that goes by the name Mr.AI.And finally, I want to leave you with my last image of Mr.AI we have come to be familiar with after Wachowski brothers gave us the never-ending quintessential Agent Smith.Can you feel it Mr. Anderson? Closing in on you? Oh I can, I really should thank you after all. It was, after all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. Purpose of life is to end.----Not-so-Futurist.

This article explains why virtual reality (VR) is a technology that canâ€™t be ignored and is already disrupting the global training market. Within five years, VR will be the primary method that workers will use to develop their skills in a safe and controlled context.What is VR?While VR only hit the commercial mainstream in 2014 with Googleâ€™s â€˜Cardboardâ€™ headset, the technology has already evolved significantly over the last five years. â€˜VRâ€™ changes perceptions of what our eyes and ears experience, removing them from our real-world context and placing them into a virtual one. This is done by using technologies such as 360 film and/or computer graphics. There are no limits on what we can experience in VR and this allows us to immerse ourselves in places and situations that are dangerous, impossible, or even just too awkward for real-life training.What skills can VR be used to develop? VR is already being used to train people in a wide variety of skills: technical, procedural, safety, people skills and emotional intelligence. Practising an awkward conversation with a virtual co-worker, recording that interaction, and reviewing to improve performance for the real thing â€” this is all already possible.Why does VR training work?Cognitively a VR simulation acts in the same way that real-life experience does; by creating new neural pathways that can be relied upon at a future date, helping us implement our skills and knowledge to manage challenging situations. The technology has multiple attributes that make it a superior training tool: complete quality control across volumes of trainees; data generation for analytical purposes; reusable and scalable content; privacy to train alone or with others; and the ability to influence perspectives to broaden understanding.Can you prove it?A lot of research has proven the validity of VR as a training medium, with the following being just a few examples:Why isnâ€™t everyone using it already? We are finally at a point where the hardware is good enough to create powerful experiential training at an affordable cost. In 2017, a high-quality VR headset and gaming computer cost $4,000 to run. Now that price is $1,000 and will be around $500 by April this year.Software development is still a laborious process for organisations wanting their own custom virtual reality training simulations. Although there are tools available to reduce the complexity of building such experiences (eg. Amazonâ€™s Sumerian), they are currently too cumbersome for lay people to use. Other platforms, like our Facilitate, are solving specific learning and development problems, such as providing high-quality experiential training that overcomes the tyranny of distance (we are based in Western Australia, after all!).The future of VR training?More solutions are continually coming to market as the technology develops, while also beginning to challenge online learning and live training in the process. Get ready for innovative learning management systems to start offering VR-enabled solutions within the next couple of years. In the meantime, start thinking about how virtual reality could revolutionise the effectiveness of your organisationâ€™s learning and development programs.Feel free to get in touch with us at Unleashed to learn how you can ease your business into VR with minimal risk and a clear business case.----VR: Welcome the Training DisruptorPeople.

When you meet a female founder or a woman with a C-Level title, donâ€™t say â€œWow, you are the CEO/COO/CTO?â€ and act surprised. I get it there is not that many, but if I were a girl and would constantly see surprised faces when my mum introduces herself, Iâ€™d not exactly be encouraged to push beyond limits.2. When introducing yourself, donâ€™t first make eye contact, say â€˜helloâ€™ and then stretch your hand to the next male person in the circle, instead of following through and reaching out and simply giving your hand to the woman next to you (youâ€™d be surprised how often that happens).3. When a female founder pitches to you what she does/builds/dreams of donâ€™t switch to looking at the risks immediately, focus on the opportunity. Ask her what she wants to achieve? Whatâ€™s the best outcome she can achieve with that? How does success look like? Building new shit is tough. You have to have monster resilience. When people constantly remind you of all the things than can go wrong, its easier to give up. I wish I would have been asked these questions more often when pitching Bunch.ai.4. Women often are good in juggling many different things and bad at asking for help or even speaking about all the things we do on a daily basis. Donâ€™t take this for granted, donâ€™t take advantage of it. Help women hustlers around you to protect their time. Nudge them to delegate. Support by taking problems off their plate and solving them. That counts for everyone who collaborates really, but women will appreciate you more for it.There is many more little things that just make us more tired than we sometimes are.

Mental models are how we understand the world. They shape what we think and how we understand connections in everything around us. Mental models are how we simplify complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason with the rest of reality.We use models to simplify the complex into understandable and organizable chunks, and something as complex as Bitcoin would be better explained using mental models anyone can grasp.â€œHigher-level behavior tends to emerge from the interaction of lower-order components.â€Bitcoinâ€™s rules are simple, but from these simple rules emerge complex systems and behaviors.â€œA small amount of specific phenomena causes a disproportionately large effect.â€Bitcoins immaculate conception caused it to be the largest and most successful digital currency. [Altcoins] are doomed to fight over a small slice of the pie (20% or less).â€œShows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so.â€If world governments cooperated, they could kill Bitcoin. However, they have individual incentives not to cooperate.â€œThe breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion.â€Contrast with emergent phenomena. [Altcoins] like EOS, Ethereum, IOTA are all architected from the top down and cannot account for black swans.â€œAn unpredictable or unforeseen event, typically one with extreme consequences.â€Bitcoin itself is a black swan that nobody saw coming, and consequently, effects that occur because of central bank policies like the â€™08 mortgage crisis are also black swans.â€œA phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value of a good or service. The Internet, for example.â€The more people that come into Bitcoin the more valuable Bitcoin becomes. Satoshi referred to it as self fulfilling prophecy.â€œSystems are sensitive to scale. Properties (or behaviors) tend to change when you scale them up or down.â€Bitcoin will exhibit different behaviors as it grows in size, none of use are able to predict these behaviors. All we can do is guess what size will bring.â€œA theory that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age.â€Because Bitcoin made it to ten years, we reasonably conclude that we are likely to see another decade of Bitcoin.â€œThe fundamental concepts or assumptions on which a theory, system, or method is based.â€Bitcoin strips money back to its essential properties. Ties money closely to time, aligns human action with time. Makes it simple to store productive output for later.â€œIn explaining a thing no more assumptions should be made than are necessary.â€Is this [altcoin] with no development really going to displace Bitcoin? Or is this all a ploy to scam me out of my money? What is simplest is most likely to be true.American Hodl is a Bitcoiner since 2014 and a hodler of last resort.

Sony was one of the first to fit actual speakers inside their TV but also LG has been pioneering with their Harman Kardon tuned speakers starting in their 2014 E6 models. This year also Panasonic jumps on the proper sound bandwagon with a Technics sound solution in their GZW2004. Philips is hitting it home this year in their OLED903 with a Bowers & Wilkins integrated sound bar, perhaps the best in-TV audio you can buy? Letâ€™s check out how this years LG E series OLED are rated by reviewers around the internet.LG OLED TVs are a phenomenon in the TV industry. They are the plasma TVs of this decade. Standing firm against the domination of LCD VA panels. Although the C range of LG TVs are the value for money champions, the E range of LG TVs competes with the likes of Sony A9G as a premium product.LG themselves are pitching the â€˜A.I.â€™ sound on the E9: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccj0jbqI4Dc&feature=share but is that what makes its audio great?Letâ€™s look at some popular review sites to see how the E9 fairs. What would you want from a review of an E9 TV? Of course you want to get the gist of the picture quality but since the panel is identical to the C9, the details can be found in other reviews. The perfect E9 review should include:www.whathifi.comThe mamoth of the gadget reviewing industry, known for their â€˜lushâ€™ and â€˜weightyâ€™ reviews. They describe the sound quality as â€œimpressive weight and power.â€ They rate the inbuilt sound as a â€œÂ£500 sound barâ€They could have used some more material to judge the sound quality, the reviewer mostly described the impact of sound effects, no word on musicality of the sound. The AI sound feature is judged as not useful but it remains unclear if the atmos feature also â€œsacrifices body and solidityâ€Bottom line 4/5: This review is conveys the quality of the E9 sound solution, it argues convincingly that the price premium is worth spending if youâ€™re looking for in integrated sound solution. An audiophile will be left with some questions though.www.trustedreviews.comTrusted Reviews goes into more detail on the TV as a whole, so if you donâ€™t know much about LG TVs and their WebOS user interface, you might learn something from this review.They get bonus points for brining up the E8, which they deem to have worse sound than the E7 (which would be the true value killer if it was still available). They disagree with What Hi-Fi on the usability of the AI sound, TR feel it adds bass, while WHF said it looses â€œbody and solidityâ€. They do conclude that results with AI sound are mixed.Bottom line 2/5: Trusted Reviews cover quite a lot of the TVs functionality, but for a review that tries to cover all aspects of the they could have explained more on the picture quality in various situations, no mention of known flaws of LG with near black handling or brightness flashing, something FlatpannelsHD does go into in their review. Too much time is spent in describing AI sound, but not the basic quality of the sound solution. Itâ€™s not really helping you make that purchase desicion.www.techradar.comTL;DR Techradar writes a brief matter of factly review but still praising the TV for its sound quality describing it as â€œgiving an astonishing level of audio separation for internal TV speakersâ€The E9 impresses the reviewers with its sound quality, most noted is the spaciousness of the sound and proper handling of sound effects in movie scores. The picture quality of the E9 (all of this years LG OLEDs) is also consistently rated as excellent, which makes the TV a desirable product and a very neat solution for fans of quality sound and vision.----GadghubMachiel Keizer GroeneveldinGadghub--Machiel Keizer GroeneveldinGadghub--1Machiel Keizer GroeneveldinGadghub--Machiel Keizer GroeneveldinGadghub--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Scott H.

Similarly, to build software for a mobile app or a website, good software architecture is needed. Software architecture plays an important role in producing strong software with scalable solutions.Software architecture is considered as the base of a software project, to guarantee its adaptability, security, quality, and security.In this blog, weâ€™ll be explaining what is software architecture, its significance, key considerations, and the advantages of good software architecture.Software Architecture: An OverviewSoftware architecture is a continuous process that involves a set of specialized decisions and architectural designs. They are built in such a way that the code structure can satisfy every product necessity that is being built while representing transversal attributes, like quality, performance, scalability, viability, usability, and manageability.Failure of these attributes may cause revenue loss, productivity loss, and cost overruns because of a redesign. Subsequently, a software architect must concentrate on the underlying issues in the development process during the architectural design to stay away from bad performance.Why Build Scalable Solutions With Software ArchitectureThe following are three reasons why software architecture is significant to build scalable solutions in the process of product development:The software architecture displays any usage problems you might experience. Also, it explains the various leveled structures and makes it fundamentally simpler to take decisions and deal with all changes. It enables us to get a better estimation of a project in terms of cost and time.What Makes A Good Software Architecture?The following are the attributes of good software architecture:Benefits of Software ArchitectureBy now you might have understood that good software architecture is crucial for a software project. Here are a few advantages of software architecture that will explain to you more about how it can help in your projects and why you ought to invest in good software architecture.Final ThoughtsA good software architecture helps to build a better software development process. Improving software architecture at an advanced level can cost you a lot in terms of time, money, and effort. Hence itâ€™s better to hire a good software development company with a one-time investment for a better architectural plan to secure your money and time.We hope the blog helps you to understand why good software architecture is important to build scalable solutions.

Fortunately for international students, there are endless amounts of resources on free ESL websites to help them improve their language learning skills while they are studying in the US. However, this can sometimes be overwhelming for them as there are so many options out there. It is difficult to know which sites will be the best for helping students to work on their English progress independently.So, I have made a list of a few ESL websites I have found useful and enjoyed using in my lessons and recommending them to my students. I hope you will find them useful, too!EasyworldofenglishThis great ESL learning website is divided into four sections: grammar, picture dictionary, reading, and pronunciation. It offers three different levels depending on student ability. Some of the highlights of this website are:BBC Learning EnglishThis a really fantastic resource which is very accessible for students. It has a wide variety of materials and resources for all levels of language learners. The material offered is very appealing and student-friendly, with a combination of media such as videos, podcasts, quizzes and written text.For example, The Grammar Gameshow offers cool videos accompanied by quizzes to test different aspects of grammar like modal verbs and adverbs of frequency. The News-Review section also uses videos to discuss current events in the news and uses these as reading comprehension exercises. For each video, a list of key words and idioms is given. Each video is also summarized briefly, and there is a quiz for students to test their knowledge on the language used.The 6 minute English section offers videos with discussion topics on issues which are trending and current. As well as questions and vocabulary exercises, there is also a transcript of each video which students can read simultaneously if they wish. Again, the topics chosen are very relevant and engaging for students, and offered at beginning, intermediate and advanced levels.The Lingohack section is brilliant! Each section focuses on a different group of vocabulary words linked to a topic or theme which is used in the different episodes available. A great way to learn new vocabulary!This is a website full of all kinds of resources and activities, some of which are downloadable as well. Highly recommended!EsolcoursesAnother great website is ESOL courses, which offers free lessons on a variety of topics, such as vocabulary, grammar, reading, and writing. Two sections I particularly like are the lessons based on songs, and the lessons focusing on life in the USA.The songs section is really an inspiring concept. Students pick a song from the list to listen to, and then they have to complete various exercises or quizzes, such as a gap filler exercise or comprehension questions. This is a really fun way for students to learn new vocabulary and improve their comprehension and listen to music, all at the same time!The section called Life in the USA is absolutely full of loads of amazing resources! It has lessons on American history and current events, as well as lessons on American holidays throughout the year There are enough lessons here probably to last you for many months to come. Students can do these easily at home and follow the instructions to complete the different activities. Great for improving reading comprehension!GrammarlyGrammarly is a great tool for ESL students, allowing them to proofread their work for spelling, grammar, sentence structure, and even the correct spacing. It is very easy to use and you can either add the Grammarly extension to your browser or upload a document to the Grammarly site to check your writing and assignments.If you are looking for websites that give you an overview of grammar in English or offer a more technical approach, then these two sites may be for you. Both Englishgrammarsecrets and Wyzant have a variety of resources on all aspects of grammar rules and how to apply those rules when you are conversing and writing in English. Topics such as the passive voice, irregular verbs and parts of speech are covered with additional exercises to practice. Each topic is listed in the sidebar, making it easy to find exactly what you are looking for when you visit the site.ElloEllo is an interesting ESL website which has over 2000 free ESL lessons both in audio and video formats. Ello has many contributors from all over the world, who are frequently language learners themselves, adding their resources to the lessons library. It definitely has an international focus, and also offers resources for beginners, intermediate and advanced learners. It is very student friendly in its layout and features, and easy to navigate, to find the specific topic or area on which you want to focus.Finally, if you are particularly keen on websites which will help you improve your pronunciation, you may find spoken skills useful. It offers free self-practice activities for students to develop their pronunciation skills. It also has loads of self-study listening quizzes and additional quizzes for specific tests, such as the TOEFL.I recommend taking some time to check out these websites and see which ones are the best fit for the international students in your class. The great thing is that your students can work on them independently at home or in the classroom, in pairs or in small groups. Donâ€™t miss out on these valuable resources!â€‹Once you start teaching this graphic novel you will find there are loads of different activities you can do with your students which will help them engage with the drama and understanding why Shakespeareâ€™s plays are still appealing even after 400 yearsOriginally published at https://eduhup.com on June 12, 2019.----1EduHup--EduHup--EduHup--EduHup--Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Scott H.

OK, Sie kÃ¶nnen einen Dollar auf beiden Seiten der Linie sparen, aber die effektive Preisgestaltung fÃ¼r den Adapter und die Software ist Ã¤hnlich.

Sie fahren in der Regel nur ein Auto, sodass es Ihnen egal ist, welche anderen Marken verfÃ¼gbar sind.Der letzte Teil, dem wir am meisten am Herzen liegen, ist, dass wir eine offene Architektur verwenden. Dies bedeutet, dass wir eine effektive Partnerschaft mit vielen anderen Apps eingehen.

We will dive deep into the theories and practices of collective intelligence from various perspectives, and in the end presents our approach on the subject that better utilize the inter-connectivity of our modern world.Some say that the main stakes of humanity is not hunger, poverty, peace, healthcare, or any host of other issues but our capability to build new socialorganizations that are able to provide solutions.Our main stake is collective intelligence.In todayâ€™s highly connected world, where the rate of new content producedsignificantly outpaces our capacity to absorb it, if we measure intelligence as the percent of the worldâ€™s content weâ€™ve read and understood, then weâ€™re all waking up dumber than we went to bed.We can barely keep up with all the new ideas, left alone providing solutions. This is perhaps an unexpected consequence by many social scientists when pondering about what the Internet can bring to mankind 10â€“15 years ago.Yet the dream of a unified, global collective intelligence lives on.Collective intelligence is neither a new concept nor a discovery. It is what shapes social organizations â€” from tribes to governments. From the grand scheme of things, collective intelligence can be defined as the capability of a group of people to collaborate on cognition, coordination, and cooperation of discovery, decision making, and problem solving. At this scale, it is often linked to the ability of a group of people to overcome and survive various challenges.Yet the mutation toward collective intelligence at a large scale cannothappen without a profound individual and societal transformation. Personal development through continuous learning becomes essential to achieve the ultimate goal of collective intelligence. This learning process not only operates at the individual level, but also involves the existence of a social process that transform them into shared cognitive objects.What we learn for ourselves has to also be useful for others.School education, while always has a role in taking new learners on a guided path, becomes very limited in the context of collective intelligence. In fact, it has been tried before: MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, formed in 2006, within the upper trending period from Google Trends of the term.But one can also easily noticed from the graph below that the term has ever since entering downward trends.Why?In my opinion, the main reason that greatly undermine the true value of collective intelligence is overemphasizing its relationship with Artificial Intelligence (AI), which merely trying to â€œharvestâ€ the statistical preference from public activities in order to â€œsynthesizeâ€ collective intelligence via massive amount of user data â€” for the benefit of the privileged few. After all, not that many people can afford huge computational infrastructures just for the sake of analyzing data.I call this â€œcollected intelligenceâ€, not collective intelligence. Far from it.It is ironic to see how MIT Center for Collective Intelligence interpret what they do as â€œresearch on how people and computers can work together more intelligentlyâ€ â€” a better definition for Artificial Intelligence instead.If you noticed in the Google Trends page above, there is a name of a book popping up in both related topics and queries, which expresses exactly the same thing: â€œthe combining of behavior, preferences, or ideas of a group of people to create novel insights.â€As a result, after almost two decades passed in the 21st century, in an era where high-speed internet becomes common equipment in most households, when people get connected online, most of the time they are being monitored like a product, occasionally there will be biased information injected to influence their political opinions. Thereâ€™s not much intelligence.â€œWe wanted flying cars, instead we got Ì¶1Ì¶4Ì¶0Ì¶ 280 characters.â€Exactly.The approach discussed so far toward the subject of collective intelligence can only be related by the act of gathering information from the public.The term has been hijacked by AI researchers targeting completely different goal: Under the glorified cover, it is actually forming a new kind of â€œhigh-techâ€ pyramidal intelligence with narrowed agendas and incapable of adapting to the unsteady, unpredictable and disruptive grounds of complexity â€” besides the fact that each of these AI implementations is often guarded by different interests and being used to justify the act of sniffing private user data.In the next part of this series, we will discuss how the true spirit of collective intelligence is reborn under the term of â€œcrowdsourcingâ€, and the pros and cons of that approach in reality.----2https://11be.orgJason Lin--Jason Lin--1Jason Lin--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

It all about the generation of data and information.Letâ€™s stop for a while and look at the time where websites started to become a fever. At this time, a person can only go to the website if only they know the website address first. Thus, the very first version of Google was launched as the â€œyellow pageâ€ for the World Wide Web. But the core value of the product Google itself is its crawled data from websites and the engine to display userâ€™s search results at the most relevant level. In order to rank those results, Google had to collect as much data as possible to understand the context of the keywords provided. However, the flow of information and technology has gradually affect Googleâ€™s advantages, to be specific, their data collected. Seeing threats of losing potential data coming, Google has always tried to secure their spot in the game. In 2007, the world rumbled when Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone with its own iOS. Knowing the risk of losing data of the mobile users to the control Apple, Google has no choice but to acquired Android and got into this business a year later. Later on, Google Waze, Buzz, and Plus were launched from 2009 to 2011 respectively in an attempt to challenge other growing social network like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. However, they were never successful and were completely shut down recently as a result. At the moment, the advantage of social network, where contents are continuously generated by users, were fully showed.In 2014, learning the result from IBM or Nokia, Google restructured itself to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, a new holding company headed up by former bosses of Google. Is this the sign of Google has reached its peak as top officers want to change their future investment in other products? Time will answer this question, but Google is continuing to losses their customers in products that serve a specific purpose.Recently, economic experts started to notice Amazon effect, and how it alters the habit of people searching for a product online, as there is a notable migration of search activity gravitating towards the online marketplace from search engines like Google. From 2015 to 2018, Amazon surprisingly surpassed Google for product search queries. To be more specific, in 2015, the proportion of customers searching for products on Google and Amazon is 54% and 46% respectively; but after 3 years, this number has completely reversed, with the winning belonged to Amazon. According to Paul Dalton, an international chief media officer of digital agency DigitasLBi, the consumer journeys were more likely, to begin with Amazon rather than Google. Continuing to explain, he said, â€œAs a first step, they search within Amazon, looking at products and reviews from a trusted source that Amazon is very well known for. They will either use Amazon to purchase it or jump over to a brand site to look at other products from that brand.â€A point to notice, it was not the fact that Google didnâ€™t foresee this upcoming trend, they have tried to convey customers to search for their desired product on google, by the launching of Google merchant center, and combine with Google AdWords for products to be displayed on their results page, or later called Google Shopping in 2009. However, the recent statistics discussed above has shown the gradual winning of Amazon over Google Shopping in the US market, due to the fact that customer journey in Amazonâ€™s site is proved to be much more relevant and complete, from the information provided, product recommended to the environment that they wholefully created for their consumers. On the other hand, consumers are now getting used to finding hotel information on Agoda, Trivago or Hotel.com; or letâ€™s say in Vietnam, Foody is well-known place for finding F&B stores, or Batdongsan.com.vn is one of the best portals to find information about real estate.So what are the advantages of these sites above, whose contents are focus on a specific field and users are able to participate in creating content? First of all, users will generally go to websites where they interact with the â€œsocietyâ€, create their own contents, read from the others. This is the natural demand of human beings throughout history â€” social desirability. And secondly, it is those websites who have user-generated content own their most valuable asset, user data. You might have read numerous article written about the important of data, and even big data, we are not going to mention about it much here. However, for your demonstration, what do you think is the reason for Facebook, and large shopping sites like Amazon, Lazada, Tiki, can give you recommendations and search results that interested enough for you to take a look at them? Yes, you are right, it is big data. From analyzing a large huge number of data point, these websites are able to recommend you with the result that matches you the most. Think of it like when you have your friend, who is an experienced car dealer, gives you a recommendation for your new car. The more detail you tell him, the more chance that cars he recommended will match with your ideal vehicle. For this reason, recommendation systems can only work at it best when it is backed with big data from you, the consumer, and these data should be updated at much as possible. This is the reason why Facebook, which owns many of your history and fresh generated information, can able to give such related posts and videos that you will likely to watch. Or in the case of the Amazon, through reviews of real users, your history, and the patterns of which other users usually bought along with an item, it can give you suggested products relevant to your intended buying item(s); or when you search for a product, you will be introduced to those which are made from your reference brands, with highest customer reviews, and are ready to be delivered from your near location for example. And as we discussed above, this is the main reason for people in the US choose to start searching for a product on Amazon instead of Google, where the information is left unstructured, with no relevant context or specialization to give most suitable results for a personâ€™s searched keyword.Therefore, the evolution of digital society and specific demands has lead to the notable development of social platforms that has high content relevancy over a specific area, and effective search engine. Google, as discussed above, is one of the most famous cases to prove the emergence of this technology wave. Facebook groups are appearing due to the fact that there are lack of appropriate channels for demanded user to participate in. Thus, there are such potential places for new players, and it really comes down to the question of if a specific demand of an area is large enough to build up a dedicated platform or not, and is that platform introduced in the right place, and at the right time?----Founder & CEO at ComspacesMichael LeinComspaces--Michael LeinComspaces--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

From Uber to Amazon Prime, these services are like our digital fairy godmothers commanding our every wish at the â€˜clickâ€™ of a wand. This shift in consumerism is universal, even impacting the black market (and the grey areas around it). Prostitution is the oldest trade in history and despite the varying legality, itâ€™s not been left behind with the technological revolution. Apps and other digital services are popping up everywhere, and with it brings debate around whether the application of tech in sex-for-sale is something we should embrace or be scared of.Is it safer for those involved?Firstly, the saucy â€˜call-meâ€™ cards in phone booths and windscreens are no more (mostly), and in itsâ€™ replacement is online services. These add a layer of protection to both the buyers and sellers as many apps require fully verified profiles meaning users are traceable. The organisation Ugly Mugs collects reports on people reported for sexual violence or transmitted diseases to safeguard users. And in case the initial screening isnâ€™t enough, and an escort finds themself in a dangerous situation, the app has an alert button feature to further protect them. Peppett (2012) argues that if we stop playing cat and mouse between these escorting app developers and the authorities taking them down, then prostitution could be even safer.And does that mean itâ€™s a good thing for our communities?Alongside apps making things safer for workers, there is a knock-on effect for the rest of society. Much like retailsâ€™ shift from bricks-and-mortar to eCommerce, street corners are becoming emptier and escorting apps are booming. The power of digital is taking sex workers off the streets and into the cloud. Pia Popenreiter, founder of Peppr stated this was the trigger for the creation of their sex-booking app, â€œ Walking down Oranienburger Strasseâ€¦it was chilly and I saw the poor girls on the streets, and I thought, why isnâ€™t there an app?â€. And for the general public, it putâ€™s the taboo industry hidden away. Previously, the police had to deal with such complaints and move sex-workers along, but now technology has absorbed some of that burden from our public services.But does that make the industry more accessible?However, digitising such an industry makes it readily available to the masses. In the age of Twitter wars and trolling, we see how hiding behind a screen can elicit different behaviours from people. Thereâ€™s a possibility that this digital layer could encourage someone not usually into such a trade as paid sex, to start using it. And reversely, it could encourage more young people to become suppliers of sex too. A recent study showed that 14.4% of sex workers had a post-graduate degree, showing that more people are actively choosing the profession instead of being forced into it. How big of a factor is technology in the surge of sex work?Does it normalise misogynistic attitudes?As this online market is rapidly growing, with it brings an array of unintended consequences. These digital services are taking away the human element of good olâ€™ love making and users of it are de-sensitised. Today, any consumer of any product can take to almost any digital platform to voice their opinions. And with the sex industry, where a real person is the commodity, people are rating other people like theyâ€™re TripAdvisor. Online platforms are hosting and somewhat promoting these attitudes and thus shining a light on the darkest parts of the industry.And whatâ€™s the impact for data?Another minefield for the industry is how to manage itâ€™s big and sensitive data. Even some of the largest corporations have not figured out how to handle policies such as GDPR (e.g. BAâ€™s latest data breach costing them Â£183 million). With 72,000 sex workers in the UK alone, averaging 25 clients per week, thatâ€™s 93.6 million transactions a year stored and tracked, all existing somewhere! Researchers, Wardel & Moore found that often these apps are poorly encrypted and vulnerable to data hacks. In fact they themselves were able to capture rich personal data of over 15,000 users of the app Grindr. The implications for such a data spill could be catastrophic.In summary, today we are living in a world of instant gratification, hyperconnectivty and always-on culture. And naturally the sex industry has moved in the same direction as any other. Undoubtedly, technology brings an overwhelming amount of benefits to users and workers alike, but the shift brings a wider array of problems that we canâ€™t predict or necessarily handle. One thing for certain is that the worlds oldest profession is not shutting up shop any time soon. The industry may fluctuate but it will always prevail, so we need to accept itsâ€™ inevitability and deal with itsâ€™ risks. Regulating sex work like any other market will not only ensure the correct uses of technology but also has the potential to benefit society as a whole.If you find this topic as interesting as I do and would like to talk through it, leave a comment below or get in touch.

In order to offset such a spike in pricing, retail stores have to reduce the randomness in the purchase behavior of the consumer. When people express varied purchase behavior it leads to either inventory bulk up or lack of inventory. Both are not ideal in many perspectives. It also leads to sub-optimal allocation of resources in the supply chain increasing the cost of operation.One of the major cost of retail operation is the transportation which is predominantly a function of consumer purchase behavior & seasonality. If consumerâ€™s purchase behavior can be reduced to a specific distribution then optimal resources can be allocated to transportation, last mile delivery, supply chain, inventory, vehicle fit, & labor. Reducing randomness in purchase enhances retail workflow & reduces the cost of operation.Big Day Sale can help reduce the stochasticity in the purchase behavior since people will be buying more product. Products with different customer life cycle can be tied together to increase the volume of orders. They accomplish the task of bringing people into a specific distribution for the retailer to run the operation efficiently. Organizational efficiency, improved sales, & reducing randomness in the purchase behavior helps overcome the increased cost of tariffs.Mitigating the add-on cost of tariffs would be crucial to retaining the volume of sales for the retail stores. There are a lot of avenues in retail that could benefit from workflow optimization & increased efficiency. In the time of uncertainty and lack of capital investments on the inventory, the spending patterns get affected. Demand shifting is a way to overcome inefficiencies in every part of the retail operation.Tariff can benefit innovative products and protect their sales from getting knocked off. Most companies will resort to automation as a solution to keep the production going. Keeping the production agnostic of the environment helps mitigate the cost increases.Inventory bulk up can also be addressed with the same approach. Retailers benefit from dense order volumes. Walmart has been increasing the number of products listed in Walmart & Walmart.com. The increased assortment also helps tap into newer customer segment.Inflation, Spending patterns, credit availability, wage growth, Interest rates and industrial output affects the purchase behavior of the consumer. Economic indexes that were released this week showed a slowing sales pattern, lack of industrial investments and output. Savings in the economy went down for April despite an increase in loans issued. Price of Gasoline has been increasing. Finding such anomalies in the economic trends and building counter strategy will reduce the uncertainty behind the volume of sales. Itâ€™s important to find a newer market and different segments of the audience.Another salient aspect about Walmart is they are training their employees for future job roles. They also offer Bachelor in Supply Chain degree at $1 a day to alleviate the student loan crisis.----I am an Data Scientist And an Entrepreneur.

Iâ€™m a hyper-focused person. I donâ€™t multi-task well. I canâ€™t listen to someone speak while I check a text message. I often find myself saying â€œcan you repeat that?â€ on calls because I wasnâ€™t paying attention. I get distracted easily, and when I get distracted, I hyper-focus on that distraction. Itâ€™s a tough personality trait to manage but I do my best.Iâ€™ve tried not bringing my cell phone into meetings or keeping it in my pocket on silent mode. Iâ€™ve tried the Pomodoro technique. Iâ€™ve battled with meditation. Some days are better than others. Maybe Iâ€™m a byproduct of our millennial, technology-infested generation. Adding fuel to the fire Iâ€™m borderline ADD, more fidgety than a spinner, and a certified daydreamer. My favorite encounter is asking someone what their name is and immediately tuning out to hear the response. Youâ€™ve been there.This lifestyle, of course, has led to many, many business ideas. Iâ€™m like the crazy toy guy constantly pitching new ideas to my friends and family. Usually, the ideas stink, but thereâ€™s no such thing a bad idea, right? I learned from some of the best entrepreneurs (Buffett, Jobs, Gates) that FOCUS is the number one ingredient to success. So Iâ€™ve preached focus when talking to my team and clients. Yet, looking at my daily life I am far from focused. I am running an agency, invested in 20 different companies, launching two new companies, running a bowling league and an entrepreneurial event series.Iâ€™ve questioned my motives and wonder if Iâ€™m spreading myself too thin. But at the end of the day, I keep forging ahead on all fronts. I do it because I love what I do. I like managing a lot of different things. Would I be more successful if I just focused on one thing? Probably. But Iâ€™m a dreamer and the world needs people like me.â€œThe people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones that do.â€â€” Steve JobsI think Iâ€™ve found an answer to my lack of focus. A way to let me ponder and dream while achieving a high level of execution. That answer is Delegation. I understand the things that I do best, and I find people that compliment those skills that I can delegate tasks to. My favorite structure for a new business is where I get to focus on the things I do best â€” branding, operations, legal, and pursuing the execution of the business through the machine that is my company King Tide. One of the new businesses Iâ€™m launching is a CPG brand for bath products â€” Bathful. I got to create the product, brand the company, and then found an investor/operator to handle the backend of the business. Meanwhile, my team will execute on e-commerce development and marketing. In essence, I am still focused on the things I do best while building a team that can execute alongside me.Iâ€™ll always make mistakes and Iâ€™ll continue learning and growing. Maybe I am spread too thin. Maybe I should focus on one business. But for now, I am motivated to be successful in many different verticals. If Elon Musk can do it, why canâ€™t I? Did I just compare myself to the greatest inventor of our generation? Yes. And I feel great about it. Iâ€™m a dreamer. Let me dream.â€œYou may say that Iâ€™m a dreamer, but Iâ€™m not the only one.

I know this because my phone number was 415 999â€“0460, and Motorola told me the numbers were being assigned sequentially. They anticipated only a small subset of the population would ever want them.Fast forward to Apple introducing the iPhone in 2007. It was the first truly personal computer, and the velocity of uptake and innovation enabled by customizable â€œappsâ€ exploded. Mobile software companies drove both new virtual activities like texting, mobile gaming, and photo-sharing, and eventually they created platforms and programs for new, phone-based ways to access familiar services like summoning a ride or making a bank deposit. Consumers loved the 24/7 convenience and personalized new tools.Inside corporations, innovation in the form of intranets, database management software and process automation had a huge impact beginning in the 1980s. But for the last decade or more, technology innovation has stalled. When I talk with high-level information technology executives at some of Americaâ€™s largest enterprises these days, they say their leadership and peers are preoccupied with infrastructure issues like network response time and security.What we are finding at Inxeption is that at many large corporations, the focus on network speed and security keep an IT department busy, but it may mask a real deficit in customer-oriented innovation throughout the enterprise. I believe customers â€” and Iâ€™m talking about business customers, not consumers â€” feel that distance more than ever because their phones have convinced them they should expect more. Their bank makes it easier to pay bills, they can videoconference from a job site or shop floor, and their travel program is warning them about airport delays and suggesting alternatives.What are their suppliers doing for them?Near as we can tell, many are just encouraging them to periodically change their passwords to log onto an online catalog. And theyâ€™re urging them to speak with a sales representative, account manager, or a middleman broker or distributor, to work through their business needs. In a way, those castle walls they so diligently reinforce have become a barrier to direct communication.The LED light company Noribachi let down the drawbridge. Noribachi connected end-users directly to manufacturing, bypassing a sales force and lighting brokers. And within one day of enabling mobile orders (literally industrial lighting systems designed and ordered on a phone), 50% of the companyâ€™s sales of custom lighting fixtures arrived over the mobile interface.The two worlds Iâ€™m writing about here are coming together at Inxeption. The innovations in personal technology are allowing business customers to communicate with a business partner and submit an order as easily from an airport lounge as from behind a desk. Meanwhile, for the manufacturer, capturing more and more customer data that your sales team or distributor middlemen used to control, and allowing a more transparent transaction, has both immediate and long-term benefits and cost-savings.Middlemen long have tried to be the interpreters of customer needs and preferences, and manufacturers may design products and systems based on their filters. Is it surprising middlemen are biased to emphasize what supports their own profits in these transactions? Of course not, thatâ€™s what middlemen do. A few may do it in a way where everybody wins. The rest are cutting manufacturers out of an opportunity to expand their interactions with customers and improve that relationship for mutual benefit.Customers have personal technology thatâ€™s made them comfortable and happy talking with partners â€” in life, in banking, in book-buying, in ride-sharing, in investing â€” directly. In fact, studies show that when B2B companies implement ecommerce, 80% say their customersâ€™ expectations have changed because of B2C practices. The companies that use online transactions to understand and better serve those customers and work in partnership with them to grow their business, are going to win big. Inxeptionâ€™s mission is to make that happen. We cut out the middlemen, we enable convenient and more satisfying transactions, and we make possible high-value products that delight business customers.Originally published at buzz.inxeption.com.----The industrial commerce company.

Because of the high value, low mileage, and low speed of electrical cars, their usage was restricted. Thoâ€™ the environmental issues have forever advocated the implementation of electrical cars, the breakthrough was never achieved, till recently.Improvement in TechnologyDominating the electrical automotive market depends the maximum amount on improved battery capabilities and speed however conjointly on the value at that itâ€™s availed. As of now, all the factors have improved since their origin. New developments in EVs like Aluminum- and zinc-air batteries aim to reinforce recharge capabilities, lowering the energy storage value. Efforts also place to scale back the recharge time for EVs. In a number of the most recent models, a full charge battery has the potential to produce a mileage of up to two hundred miles.The Road Ahead for EVsSome of the main economies just like the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland have already set goals for full-fledged implementation of electrical cars. the united kingdom government plans to prevent the sales of diesel and gasoline models by 2040. itâ€™s conjointly explicit that hybrid or EVs can comprise nearly 1/2 the new vehicles. firms like Tesla and a few of the main Chinese firms have complete the longer-term demand for this technology and square measure investment extensive sums during this technology.

My team builds content portals that allow editors to create magic for our customers in the video services we power.I previously wrote on an Article about using the Angular CLI to create multiple projects within a single workspace. The way things are configured by default, every project uses the same port, and as such cannot be run at the same time. This prompted some reader feedback from SaÅ¡a Marinkov:â€œSince all the applications use the same port, you canâ€™t run them at the same time, but that was fine for our original goals.â€ so what if we want every sub app to work on different port?There is a way! In the root directory of your application, find a file named angular.json. This contains the configuration for the Angular CLI development environment. Drill down into â€œprojects.my-app.architect.serveâ€. Youâ€™ll see something like this:This block contains some configuration for the ng serve command. You can specify the port by adding a port attribute in the options block, like this:Now my app is built to run off port 8080. Run the app:Youâ€™ll notice the first line on the console shows the port number:Load the browser to http://localhost:8080:Congratulations, you reconfigured the port!The root of Sasaâ€™s original question was to run all projects on different ports, though. You can make a similar change for the ng serve configuration on each project. First find â€œproject.app1.architect.serveâ€:In the options section, I added port 8081. Then, I find â€œproject.app2.archtect.serveâ€:For the second application, I set it to use port 8082. Now with multiple console windows, you can run all the applications at once:I had to run each project in a separate console window. You can open all three projects at once in separate browsers:If you are making use of the Angular CLIs multi-project feature, and need to run multiple projects side by side simultaneously, this is how you can do it so the two projects do not interfere with each other.----1disney-streamingIâ€™m a technical entrepreneur who likes to build cool things and share them with other people.

Actually, one might even argue that the world is already heavily so. Nevertheless, caution is advised since roughly half of the worldâ€™s population does not even have Internet access [1]. Yes, dinner has just started.Multiple topics of interest could potentially captivate these distinguished guests. Privacy has, however, one specific topic in mind: gaps. Each guest is knowledgeable in their specific area, each guest effectively contributes to the same society, and all are interconnected, interdependent yet each one speaks its own language. There are, in fact, huge gaps between the way each one perceives the world and, consequently, how they interact with Privacy. The ubiquity of Tech, the inevitability of Law and the drive of Business were due a friendly dinner to spark the conversation around one of todayâ€™s hot topics: individual privacy in a heavily data-centric society.Business: Privacy, you know I am fond of you but, to be honest, from the point of view of the numbers, the advantages of data collection, processing, and the intelligence that is possible to gather from those, greatly outweighs any of the downsides. Actually, most people do not even care about you. They have nothing to hide.This is a strong statement by Business. It is undeniable how an historical disregard for privacy has enabled the growth of many businesses [2] and how sometimes this results in beneficial applications [3]. Is it all only about numbers? Exploitation of individualâ€™s data has become common even in some of the most sensitive domains. Finance is one of the key sources of juicy information [4].Law: No, no, no! Please do not use the â€˜nothing to hideâ€™ argument. It is clearly a fallacy and very misleading [5]. If you play that card, I need to play the Snowden one: â€œArguing that you donâ€™t care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is like arguing that you donâ€™t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.â€ [6]. What we need is stronger legislation and continue the path of improving our law frameworks. GDPR is a good example! Privacy is a fundamental right! [7]Important points made here. In fact, Privacy goes well beyond having something to hide. It is closely related to our freedom [8]. Without privacy, there is no freedom. However, legislation cannot answer this challenge on its own. There is an immense gap between what is stated, for instance, in the GDPR and the actual technology landscape of our days. What is possible to do in the areas of AI, machine learning and business intelligence goes greatly beyond what the lack of an explicit consent can impede [9]. How can this fantastic potential and fast evolution pace can still contribute to a free and plural society?Tech: Law, Iâ€™m with you but how can you cope with things that most people cannot understand? How can you legislate over technology or processes that only a few people in the world actually fully master?We hit a critical point. There is indeed a gap between business goals that might get too number-driven and the quest for solutions that might improve peopleâ€™s lives. There is a gap between the principles the Law aims to protect, the praxis and actual capacity of enforcement when dealing with technological contexts. There is a gap between technology advancements and privacy requirements of individuals. However, arguably, the largest of gaps is the one separating what is technologically possible, what is understood to be possible, and how data-driven businesses actually work.It is our claim that solutions should begin at the technological level. Technology should become increasingly transparent. Being technologically savvy or holding and engineering degree should not be a requisite for understanding what exactly is being done with oneâ€™s individual data. The design of an application, a device or product should clearly indicate how it manages data processing flows and the nature of such flows. Even in the case where code cannot be disclosed. This is a huge but key challenge.This idea, in fact, is not new. The concept of privacy-by-design is present in the GDPR [10] and is extensively used in many contexts. Some companies are also pushing for a model where sensitive data is processed on device instead of populating large data lakes, which privacy-wise is an interesting alternative. The fact is that, independently of the model chosen, there is still a long way to go in terms of the actual technological tools available for providing truly private services and applications. Without further investment and technological advances in privacy-preserving systems it will become terribly difficult to manage Business drivers, write suitable Law and ensure a truly free society.It is of critical importance to prevent bad things from happening and, on this topic, prevent any misuse of personal, sensitive, and private data. However, we believe it is even more important to come up with technical solutions that make those behaviours simply impossible and unnecessary.[1] https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm [2] https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/20/facebook-violating-privacy-mark-zuckerberg [3] https://www.wired.com/story/google-location-tracking-turn-off/ [4] https://thefinancialbrand.com/74854/fintech-mobile-banking-app-data-privacy/ [5] â€œIâ€™ve Got Nothing to Hideâ€™ and Other Misunderstandings of Privacyâ€, Daniel J.

The goal of incubators is to decrease the chance that a startup will fail, and shorten the time and reduce the cost of establishing and growing its business. If successful, business incubators can help to nurture the fast-track companies that form the true creators of a regionâ€™s or nationâ€™s future wealth and employment.Business incubation programs are often sponsored by private companies or municipal entities and public institutions, such as colleges and universities. Their goal is to help create and grow young businesses by providing them with necessary support and financial and technical services. There are approximately 900 business incubators nationwide, according to the National Business Incubation Association.Incubators provide numerous benefits to owners of startup businesses. Their office and manufacturing space is offered at below-market rates, and their staff supplies advice and much-needed expertise in developing business and marketing plans as well as helping to fund fledgling businesses. Companies typically spend an average of two years in a business incubator, during which time they often share telephone, secretarial office, and production equipment expenses with other startup companies, in an effort to reduce everyoneâ€™s overhead and operational costs.Business incubation programs are highly coveted platforms for all entrepreneurs which enables them to enjoy the benefits of private equity.Equity is money from investors, the owner is relieved of the pressure to meet the deadlines of fixed loan payments. However, he does have to give up some control of his business and often has to consult with the investors when making major decisions.Less risk: You have less risk with equity financing because you donâ€™t have any fixed monthly loan payments to make. This can be particularly helpful with startup businesses that may not have positive cash flows during the early months.Credit problems: If you have credit problems, equity financing may be the only choice for funds to finance growth. Even if debt financing is offered, the interest rate may be too high and the payments too steep to be acceptable.Cash flow: Equity financing does not take funds out of the business. Debt loan repayments take funds out of the companyâ€™s cash flow, reducing the money needed to finance growth.Long-term planning: Equity investors do not expect to receive an immediate return on their investment. They have a long-term view and also face the possibility of losing their money if the businesses fail.One tech hub that has been the pacesetter in Abia state is the Innovation Growth Hub, the brain child of Daniel Chinagozi ,Ezinne Uzoije ,Jethro Theo Paul, Ngwube Stella Ginikachukwu . The Innovation Growth Hub offers the following bespoke services:Startup SupportWe providing mentorship and general support to Startups and Teams brimming on fresh innovative ideas.Co-working SpaceCo-working Space tailored to teamâ€™s size and budget with business services support.Web DevelopmentDesigning and developing high impact websites and web applications using modern technologies that guarantees your success.Startup ConsultingFrom the ground up, we help your Startup have the right foundation to transform to a major movement.CommunityWeâ€™re community of entrepreneurs and professionals backgrounds to offer you support, collaboration and opportunities.App DevelopmentPush your business outreach further and engage with your customers and clients more with an app development deal from us.Tech EcosystemWe provide opportunities and resources for you to meet with like minds through our events and trainings.EventsValue-driven events such as hackathons, Start-up, Weekends, workshops, digital marketing training and other events.Digital MarketingLetâ€™s grow and generate new leads for your business.

Through our Online Community, Meetups and StartUp Weekends, we have seen an increase in the number of people determined to provide solutions for their community and beyond using technology.June last year, IGHub is set to launch the IGHub BizBoost Incubation program where Startups will be provided with support and resources necessary to grow their businesses into sustainable brands that can solve problems extensively while employing people.The program is open to startup teams from anywhere in the world that are looking to grow their businesses in Africa, particularly Nigeria. The startups will have to work from our Incubation Hub in Aba for 12 weeks!This Incubation program is ideal for Startups who are beyond their idea phase; great for Startup teams with technology solutions that addresses a clear need/want and has the potential to scale.OUTLINE OF PROGRAMShortlisted Startups will have the opportunity to pitch in front of a carefully selected panel in order to secure a spot at the Incubation program.The Incubation Program includes a robust module which involves Business Modeling, Growth hacking, Financial Acquisition and Modelling and so much more. Core emphasis will be laid on growth and acceleration of these Startups therefore entrepreneurs will get one-on-one sessions with carefully selected mentors.TIMELINEThe IGHUB BizBoost incubation program will be intensive; running for 12 consecutive weeks followed by 12 months Post Incubation Support where the startups have monthly access to Consultation.The Startups will have access to industry mentors, and also key players from within the Startup Ecosystem.FINANCING OPPORTUNITIESEach startup will receive $10,000 in exchange for 10% equity.In addition, at the end of the Incubation program will be a Demo Day where each team will pitch in front of an audience of key Investors and Stakeholders across all strata and stand a chance of getting more funding.This awesome business opportunity is poised to develop startups in the south east of Nigeria especially Abia state.Some of these startups include Salesbay, Inaaga, The Footwear Academy, Ogwugo, IgMart and Clintonel Innovation Centre.SalesbaySalesbay is Nigeriaâ€™s foremost supply chain platform portal with primary focus on Made In Nigeria an Africa products. They initialized on November 2017 and their mission is to aggregate local manufacturers/sellers with local and international buyers, while ensuring trust and maintaining quality. Their coverage span across various industries under various categories including clothing, shoes, agriculture, consumer goods and so much more.They are so committed to customer success and satisfaction.

Their first contact cities are Aba, umuahia, and Onitsha from where they will spread to other cities.Others include The Footwear Academy, CIC and Igmart.With several talented people doing amazing stuffs in tech, there is need to grow their ecosystem to become world class. But thereâ€™s a problem. Thereâ€™s no platform for these youths to come together and collaborate, share resources and maximise individual potentials.They took their movement further to the calm, quiet but vibrant city of Umuahia to paint their goodwill message that the light has come for people who are working on various innovation projects to have a platform that will help them succeed.That message ended up as Startup Weekend Abia 2016 â€” the only Startup Weekend event held in Nigeria that year.Dawn of a new beginningWith combine efforts of other players in their ecosystem, they had bright outing in 2017 with their city organizing major events in their region.Just in 2017 alone, in alliance with the other ecosystem drivers, they hosted the Techpoint Media Tour, Google Developers Festival (DevFest 18), Startup South3 (Made In Aba Edition) and of course, organized Startup Weekend Abia 2017 for the record third time.These events will later usher a new beginning into the development of their local ecosystem with promising returns as more people joined their movement.Consolidation of their hopeThereâ€™s no better way to celebrate their journey so far without including women. Ever since they started, theyâ€™ve seen a lot of women change makers doing amazing stuffs for the society and changing the narrative of what they used to be known for.This commitment led to their organizing Startup Weekend Women Abia 2018. The success recorded positioned them to represent Nigeria at the regional level of the global event and they would later win to represent Africa at Paris.Our journey so far has the contribution of women and for 2018, thereâ€™s still more to come.----Project Manager | Writer | Digital Strategist | Entrepreneur | SI4DEV Fellow | CW Open Source Leader | Global SDG InnovatorFRANKLIN NWACHUKWU--FRANKLIN NWACHUKWU--FRANKLIN NWACHUKWU--FRANKLIN NWACHUKWU--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

How do you present yourself as a viable candidate for a role in your dream industry when your prior experience doesnâ€™t seem to add up?When it comes to LinkedIn, stick with the profile you already have created, but enhance it. Weave a story that combines your interests and transferable skills, focusing on what you want to be known for, not your current or prior job duties. No need to create multiple profiles for all of your industry experiences (at best, it will be confusing to potential employers; at worst, youâ€™ll be pegged for spam).Did you spend 5 years as an administrative assistant? Great â€” sounds like youâ€™re detail-oriented.Were most of your jobs up to this point spent asking, â€œDo you want fries with that?â€ Cool â€” sounds like your customer service skills should be up to par.Do you live and die for a stage, auditioning for the lead in the latest community theater performances? Perfect â€” sounds like an excellent communicator who can work with a team.But your intentions wonâ€™t be obvious to a potential employer unless they are clearly presented. Use the Summary section to define who you are and what you want to be doing, adding in what makes you unique. Draw from your past experiences to help set you apart from what may be a stale candidate pool.Will you have to work harder than the candidate with a more formal education and directly related experience to land the job? Yup. But many employers are turning to alternative methods of finding talent that lead to a more well-rounded staff with diverse backgrounds.Thereâ€™s no need for an identity crisis when switching careers.

Watch these 10 TED Talks that explore our complex relationship with technology.About the speaker:Cal Newport is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Georgetown University and the author of five books about improving performance at school and in the workplace.Summary:Does quitting social media make you an unemployable Luddite? Computer scientist Dr. Cal Newport doesnâ€™t think so. In this eye-opening talk, he debunks three objections commonly offered up as rationale for keeping that all-important Facebook account.About the speaker:James Brindle is an artist and writer based in London whose work deals with the ways in which the digital world reaches into the physical and offline one.Summary:Writer and artist James Bridle uncovers a dark, strange corner of the internet, where unknown people or groups on YouTube hack the brains of young children in return for advertising revenue. From â€œsurprise eggâ€ reveals and the â€œFinger Family Songâ€ to algorithmically created mashups of familiar cartoon characters in violent situations, these videos exploit and terrify young minds. They tell us something about where our increasingly data-driven world is headed.About the speaker:Eli Pariser is the author of â€œThe Filter Bubble,â€ about how personalized search might be narrowing our worldview. He is the CEO of Upworthy, a website for â€œmeaningfulâ€ viral content and president of MoveOn.org, a progressive public policy advocacy group and political action committee.Summary:As web companies strive to tailor their services (including news and search results) to our personal tastes, thereâ€™s a dangerous unintended consequence: We get trapped in a â€œfilter bubble.â€ Weâ€™re no longer exposed to information that could challenge or broaden our worldview. Eli Pariser argues powerfully that this will ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy.About the speaker:Adam Alter is an Assistant Professor of Marketing and Psychology at New York University and the author of Drunk Tank Pink, a book that explores the forces that shape how we think, feel, and behave within the digital age.Summary:What are our screens and devices doing to us? Psychologist Adam Alter studies how much time screens steal from us and how theyâ€™re getting away with it. He shares why all the hours you spend staring at your smartphone, tablet or computer might be making you miserable and what you can do about it.About the speaker:Scott Galloway is a Professor of Marketing at the New York University Stern School of business. He is a public speaker and author of â€œThe Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.â€Summary:The combined market capitalization of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google is now equivalent to the GDP of India. How did these four companies come to infiltrate our lives? In a spectacular rant, Scott Galloway shares insights and eye-opening stats about their dominance and motivation. He reveals what happens when a society prizes shareholder value over everything else. Followed by a Q&A with TED Curator Chris Anderson. (Note: This talk contains graphic language.)About the speaker:Tristan Harris is the director and a co-founder of The Center for Humane Technology, and co-founder of the Time Well Spent movement. He is a former Google Design Ethicist developing a framework for how technology should â€œethicallyâ€ steer the thoughts and actions of billions of people from screens.Summary:A handful of people working at various tech companies steer the thoughts of billions of people every day, says design thinker Tristan Harris. From Facebook notifications to Snapstreaks to YouTube autoplays, theyâ€™re all competing for one thing: your attention. Harris shares how these companies prey on our psychology for their own profit and calls for a design renaissance in which our tech instead encourages us to live out the timeline we want.About the speaker:Jennifer Golbeck is an associate professor in the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland and director of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the same university. She is also the author of the book, â€œAnalyzing the Social Web.â€Summary:Do you like curly fries? Have you â€œlikedâ€ them on Facebook? Find out the surprising things Facebook (and others) can guess about you from your random â€œlikesâ€ and â€œshares.â€ Computer scientist Jennifer Golbeck explains how this came about, how some applications of the technology are not cute and why we should return the control of information to its rightful owners.About the speaker:Sherry Turkle has spent 30 years researching the psychology of peopleâ€™s relationships with technology. She is the Abby Rockefeller Mauze Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society at MIT.Summary:As we expect more from technology, do we expect less from each other? Sherry Turkle studies how our devices and online personas are redefining human connection and communication. This talk will have you thinking deeply about the new kinds of connections we want to have.About the speaker:Jon Ronson is a journalist and documentary filmmaker whose works include â€œThe Men Who Stare at Goatsâ€ and â€œThe Psychopath Test.â€Summary:Twitter gives a voice to the voiceless, a way to speak up and hit back at perceived injustice. But sometimes things go too far. In a jaw-dropping story of how one un-funny tweet ruined a womanâ€™s life and career, Ronson shows how online commenters can end up behaving like a baying mob. He says itâ€™s time to rethink how we interact online.About the speakers:Kashmir Hill is a privacy pragmatist who writes about the intersection of law, technology, social media and our personal information.Surya Mattu is a data reporter on Gizmodoâ€™s Special Projects Desk, an R&D journalism resident at Eyebeam NYC and a Research Scientist at the Center for Civic Media at the MIT Media lab.Summary:Once your smart devices can talk to you, who else are they talking to?

More recently youâ€™ve heard of how blockchain promises to save the music industry. What you havenâ€™t heard yet is how blockchain intends to flip the telecom industry upside down.The telecom industry is outdated. Period. Locking ourselves into long-term, expensive contracts? Why are we still doing this? What the industry desperately needs is a shake-up and we, at ELYNET, are working on doing just that. We are planning to offer the world mobile services without contracts, without expensive overages and the best part is, your data packages NEVER expire.We truly believe that once you buy data, you should have full ownership of it. We as consumers have been accepting a time limit on our mobile services for forever and without good reason. Our no expiration policy is something out of a telecom giantâ€™s nightmares and we made it even scarier: Data reselling, gifting and donating! Oh my! Those options will finally be available to the billions of telecom users around the world and without having to visit a store.Quite the shake up, huh? Well we have blockchain technology to thank for this, because it promises to make all of our wallets a little heavier each month. Using blockchain technology to backbone our telecom network allows us to offer the high quality mobile services you expect, but at a fraction of the cost. High speeds, high quality, but lower prices: Finally!Blockchain and the jargon that comes along with it, sounds daunting to the average consumer and we know that. Thatâ€™s why we kept it a priority to make purchasing data hassle free. Anyone around the world will be able to purchase mobile data packages for their phoneâ€¦ straight from their phone! You wonâ€™t need to change your current provider or get a SIM either. Everything can be done safely and efficiently through your device.By simply downloading the ELYNET software system, Crude, anyone can purchase mobile data right from their phone and get connected immediately. This software simply works in the background to keep you connected to the internet 24/7. We, at ELYNET, think you deserve a smoother experience wherever and however you use your phone. Crude ensures that your connection never breaks, even when you switch from LTE to Wi-Fi.ELYNET was founded by a team of people that have been in the telecom industry for over 50 years collectively. They know the ins and outs needed to get users the fast internet they want, but at the price they want to pay for it. They were able to discover the redundant costs within the telecom industry that make mobile plans so high. Then, by eliminating them with the help of blockchain technology, there was a possibility for a huge cost savings. All those cost savings are for the users, to give them a better mobile service option and, more importantly, the cheapest option.Look out for ELYNET, launching later this year!www.elynet.io for further details.----The worldâ€™s first SIM-LESS blockchain telecom network! www.elynet.io Join our telegram community: https://t.me/elynetElyNet--ElyNet--ElyNet--ElyNet--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alex Mathers--220HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

And some of the recent social/entertainment apps actually make it seem that way. Those, however, are the exceptions. Entrepreneurship is actually about solving problems. Problems pressing enough, that your customers would be willing to give you their money.Every (starting) entrepreneur has that idea, which is heavily based on their assumption of what potential customers may need. And a very common mistake is being adamant about those assumptions, not changing it along the way. The key is to test those assumptions early on, and gain actionable insights through customer feedback. The idea is very well established into the leading â€œlean startup methodologyâ€. Test and (in)validate assumptions as quickly and as early, as possible in a â€œbuild-measure-learnâ€ loop.Sounds great in theory, doesnâ€™t it? Letâ€™s see a practical example of this notion. At Endeavor Bulgaria we screen hundreds of companies every year, to eventually work with a handful of the most-dynamic companies and entrepreneurs, on their way to global scale. Our latest portfolio company is the perfect incarnation of this problem/solution mentality: Tiger Technology, led by Alex Lefterov, a serial entrepreneur with a background of solving complex technical problems for over 25 years.Tiger Technology started all the way back in 2004 by creating much-needed storage and collaboration solutions for the Media & Entertainment industry. With a growing M&E industry screaming for help, Tiger Technology quickly established a solid presence, being among the first movers in the market. Few years later, storage technology advancements, stale M&E industry, and market saturation meant Alex and Tiger Tech had to find other ways to grow.Fast forward to 2016, Alex is sitting in a room with IBM and Milestone, discussing potential application of Tigerâ€™s media storage solutions in the surveillance industry. By that time the cloud had become pretty popular, and the surveillance data had to be stored, and later processed in the cloud. There goes the problem: applications on your computer can not interact directly with files stored in the cloud. They just â€œdonâ€™t speak the same languageâ€. Until that point, Tiger Tech was never focused on bridging local applications and cloud data.This is where an entrepreneur notices an opportunity and puts his head down to work. With a booming cloud migration market, Alex realizes the problem is much bigger than a single project. Actually, itâ€™s almost a $2-billion-dollar problem (Cloud Storage Gateway has a $1.96B market size in 2018), expected to be $3.5 billion in 2020.With over 10 years of experience in building state-of-the-art storage systems, Alex and his team of engineers built Tiger Bridge, a brilliant middle-layer software enabling any application to work directly with files from the cloud (or tape).By addressing a real customer problem, the company finds itself among the first movers in an exciting new market, which is growing by over 30% annually.The perfect example on the importance of customer feedback, during and even before, building a new product.----Endeavor BulgariaEnterDAO & LimeChainZhivko TodorovinEnterDAO--2Endeavor BulgariainEndeavor Bulgaria--Endeavor BulgariainEndeavor Bulgaria--Zhivko TodorovinEnterDAO--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Aaron Dinin, PhDinEntrepreneur's Handbook--8Unbecoming--768Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Hunter Walk--15Fiona Renate--53HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Zomatoâ€™s CEO, Deepinder Goyal, seized this opportunity to get his company some viral publicity and tweeted a schmaltzy response about food not having religion. Predictably, the internet went wild. All my Whatsapp groups comprising family, school alumni, fraternities, professional networks, and other hobby groups posted screen-grabs of this post at least once.Goyal put on a display of classic gaslighting. I am a member of multiple food-related Facebook and Whatsapp groups. Nary a day passes without at least one person on each of these groups posting a Zomato horror story. Poor delivery, indifferent service, are common with Zomato â€” the company refuses ownership for order-related problems and the buck passes back and forth between Zomato and the restaurant until the customer just gives up. With just one tweet, Goyal turned all of twitter and Facebook into his flying monkeys â€” leaving aggrieved customers struggling with the cognitive dissonance of being abused by such an â€œawesomeâ€ company with such apparently lofty ethics. Serious issues such as the companyâ€™s abuse of smaller restaurants and exploitation of its drivers were rapidly forgotten.Earlier this year, Indigo Airlines refused to let my daughter board a flight for which she had a ticket. The Indigo staff at the counter had no explanation for the fact that it was a return ticket and that she had already travelled one leg of the journey without any issues. They refused to issue her a boarding pass unless I paid more money. Not wanting to be stranded at Udaipur Airport with a 9-month old child, I paid up. When I complained to their customer care line, they said that â€œall charges demanded were correctâ€ and had no explanation for how Vivien got â€œunbookedâ€ for the return leg of a round-trip journey.Indigoâ€™s tone changed when I wrote an article about my ordeal on LinkedIn and posted it to Twitter. Within a day, an unusually articulate employee phoned me about granting me a refund â€œas a matter of courtesyâ€. It so happens that Indigoâ€™s threshold for courtesy is when an aggrieved customer complains on Social Media. No notions of courtesy afflicted their employees at Udaipur airport when I stood there with an increasingly aggravated child in my arms â€” I was then just a hapless flier who could be coerced into making a payment.Indigo didnâ€™t care a damn about my predicament until I went up on social media with a feature-length article detailing my experience. Like any Narcissist, it sprang into image management mode in offering a â€œcourtesyâ€ refund for my trouble. All-in-all, an insincere and condescending apology considering everything that they put me through.It struck me that through social media gaslighting and image buffing â€” both Zomato and Indigo were displaying the traits of a textbook variety narcissist. To be fair, Zomato and Indigo are not alone in such behaviour. Many other New Economy companies have only paid heed to my complaints after I have brought them out on Social Media after being frustrated by their service staff. Itâ€™s impossible to have a healthy relationship with a company that only responds to you when its poor behaviour is out in public. Similarly, low-integrity companies that use meaningless gestures such as Goyalâ€™s tweet to create a buzz donâ€™t deserve respect.A close friend owns a vintage Leica film camera. Itâ€™s a prized family heirloom that he keeps in very good repair. A few months ago, while walking around London taking â€œstreetâ€ photos, he was dismayed to discover that the shutter button on the camera wasnâ€™t smooth and and required substantially more force than usual. The concierge at his hotel informed him that there was a Leica shop just down the road â€” where he could â€œtry his luckâ€. Stepping into the shop, he was already thinking about the costs that a repair would entail â€” considering that today a Leica is a tool for the privileged. Instead, a genuinely warm shop employee handled his camera with the kind of affection and tenderness typically reserved for a day-old infant. Other shop employees gathered around and heaped praise on the immaculate condition of his decades old camera and lens. One employee asked him to consider their camera exchange programme that would allow him to transition to a digital camera â€” the condition of his device would mean a resale price that would qualify him for a top-notch digital Leica, with additional cash to pocket. He declined of course.The next morning, a Leica employee visited his hotel and delivered the camera with butter smooth shutter button. Furthermore, the rangefinder and lens had been cleaned â€” completely free of charge.How does a Leica remain the dream camera of every enthusiast? How can a company sell a digital camera that takes only black and white photos for USD 8,000? Other cameras today that cost a fifth as much are faster and have more bells and whistles. Of course Leicaâ€™s legendary workmanship and image â€œfeelâ€ are a big part of its reputation, but the company surely left a lasting impression on my friend with the care and effort that it took with his camera. No internet complaints, no talking to some phone rep â€” no tweeting or anguished Facebook posts needed â€” Itâ€™s our camera â€” weâ€™ll fix it. Again, no cheesy tweet to balance out other image problems and no contradiction between actions and proclaimed values. My friend probably told this story to everyone who would listen, and asked me to consider the brand when I was researching a camera purchase â€” incidentally, thatâ€™s how I heard this story.Quality, Humility, Service â€” thatâ€™s kept Leica at the top of the game through two world wars and nine eventful decades. Goyal probably doesnâ€™t have a vision for Zomato stretches that far.----I am a writer, corporate ethics specialist, film photographer, and investor based in Hyderabad, India. www.boethius.inAjit Nathaniel--Ajit Nathaniel--Ajit Nathaniel--3Ajit Nathaniel--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Working closely with Archetype Media, Space Between and Mindshare, our team were tasked with delivering an artistic representation of a â€˜new expression of airâ€™, to celebrate the new 270 silhouette housing Nikeâ€™s biggest air bubble to date.Studio founder, Christie Morgan, was selected to be one of the faces of the campaign. As the brief was to deliver innovation through collaboration, it was only natural that she be paired with her childhood friend Miniswoosh (aka London-based fashion designer, Alexandra Hackett). Miniswoosh is predominantly known for her imaginative deconstruction and reconstruction of Nike garments, such as turning a Nike duffel bag into a tactical vest, or a bunch of Nike gym socks into a turtleneck.As Alexandra works with physical garments, and Pitch is digital-first, it was necessary to ensure that both parties would be fairly represented in the final body of work. Alexandra and Christie decided that the best move forward would be to host a collaborative workshop on the roof of Melbourneâ€™s iconic Curtin House venue (the designated hub for the week of Air Max activity).For this project (as with all of our projects) we were adamant that a digital component be at the core of this collaboration, and called on the Pitch team to form a creative response that would fulfil the brief requirements. They decided to create a garment customisation app for use at the workshop, and engaged technology partner GUCK from the wider Pitch network to develop and build the app.As with most global marketing campaigns, the lead time for execution was tight. The app was forecasted to take 3-months to complete, but the team spent several late nights pulling it together in order to make the 1-month deadline. It almost broke us, but we all came together to deliver the project!We envisioned a library of 3D objects based on the Air Max 270 detailing. These 3D objects were then used within the app to form the base design of a custom Nike t-shirt, which the audience could create and keep as a memento from the event.The event space was designed and built in collaboration with Space Between and Boom Studios. A selection of custom-made Nike furniture made by Miniswoosh was on display alongside the app, which was deployed using multi-touch LED monitorsâ€™ and iPads (and we know what youâ€™re thinking: yes, we had to build for both iOS and Android).The private event welcomed a mix of media and influencers, and appeared to be positively received based on a number of earned media features, and a high-rate of organic social shares about the collaborative event.The campaign culminated in a day-to-night event at the Nike Air House. The audience was invited to a series of workshops on the rooftop, with Christie, and Pitch Creative Director, Chris, engaged to speak on a digital art and innovation panel at the event.Pitch was also engaged by Nike to create an animation that visually communicated â€˜a new expression of airâ€™. The result was a world filled with floating bubbles and the signature swoosh, which was easily one of the most high-impact elements of the overall campaign. This was then projection mapped onto the exterior of the 8-story high Curtain House building, further amplifying the Nike campaign message across the entire Melbourne CBD.As night fell, guests were welcomed back to the roof to enjoy a live Boiler Room broadcast with Nina Las Vegas, Basenji, Corin, and Strictface performing on live stream. Pitch animations were projected onto the cinema-sized screen behind the artists, and pushed our visuals ever wider to a online global audience.The event continues to be one of our most well-received and memorable events. All touch points were considered, and it definitely did not go unnoticed by the attendees.Pitch Studios outlined a tidy app designed for Air Max day that had cuts, swoosh items, and silhouettes of bubbles that users could flick, shape, enlarge and spin to create their own customised Air Max Day t-shirt.Everything from environmental aesthetics to user experiences was done in the way Nike knows, incredible product, refinely delivered. â€” SaintsideA big thanks to the Nike team, to Miniswoosh, Archetype Media, Tundra, Boiler Room, and everyone who came along for the experience.If you want to come to our future events, sign up for our newsletter HERE so youâ€™re the first to be invited.----A future-forward design studio that creates new forms of digital experiences ðŸŒ http://pitch-studios.comPitch Studios--Pitch Studios----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

In other words, we will offer benchmarks to help split the royalty rate between technology and trademark.Understand that using a composite royalty rate as a market-based indication of a trademark royalty rate requires judgement. The first step is to carefully examine the license terms in order to clearly understand what rights are being granted to the licensee. It is also important to understand the nature of the licenseeâ€™s business as an aid to judging what are the most important needs of the licensee that are being satisfied by the license. We must remember that it is the responsibility of the trademark owner to ensure that the products or services rendered by a licensee maintain the quality standards that customers have come to expect. Hence, there are almost always additional elements such as trade secrets, know-how, procedures or a patent in the license bundle.Lacking data that can help identify the trademark portion of the rate, you can simply view the rate as a ceiling or the maximum a licensor could charge for the use of a trademark. It is also helpful to simply split the rate 50%-50%. These two suggestions, while not perfect, do supply boundaries to consider and offer a check on the reasonableness of selection of a rate by using another method.We have reviewed licenses that bundle the rights to technology and trademark included in the IPSCIO/RoyaltySource database for market-based indications of a split between trademark and technology. We found one example.The license agreement is dated July 24, 2002 and was still active as of February 2019. The parties to the agreement are Land Oâ€™Lakes, Inc. and Dean Foods Company. In general, Land Oâ€™Lakes, Inc. granted exclusive rights to use the â€œLand Oâ€™Lakesâ€ brand and the â€œIndian Maidenâ€ logo on dairy products.Land Oâ€™Lakes is a producer of dairy products, animal feed and crop seed in the United States and their product brands are well-recognized. The dairy brands include Land Oâ€™Lakes, Alpine Lace, Lake to Lake and New Yorker brands and the Indian Maiden logo. Land Oâ€™Lakes also relies on patents and trade secrets to market and protect their products. Recipes and production methods for dairy and spread products are considered valuable trade secrets.Dean Foods offers a variety of branded and private label dairy and dairy case products. These include fluid milk, ice cream, cultured dairy products, creamers, ice cream mix and other dairy products. Dean Foods also relies on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to their market products and protect their intellectual property rights.Dean Foods acquired the â€œUpper Midwestâ€ operations of Land Oâ€™ Lakes on July 10, 2000, including assets used to process milk, juice, cottage cheese, dips and other related products and executed their first trademark license agreement with Land Oâ€™ Lakes. The license was exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free and included the United States territory. Given the royalty-free provision, likely the purchase price included a lump sum amount representing a â€œpaid-upâ€ license.Two years later, on July 24, 2002, Land Oâ€™ Lakes and Dean Foods revised the license agreement. The license territory was expanded to include Canada and Puerto Rico. The exclusive, perpetual and royalty-free provisions for the original â€œBasic Dairy Productsâ€ remained the same. However, new â€œValue-Added Productsâ€ were included with defined royalty payments. Table 1 summarizes the licensed products.The surviving royalty-free provision for the Basic Dairy Products supports the observation that the original trademark license was â€œpaid-upâ€ and included in the purchase price. The Value-Added Dairy Products royalty payments are detailed in Table 2.A premium royalty rate of 3% was negotiated for â€œshelf-stableâ€ products. Land Oâ€™ Lakes has experience with aseptic and extended shelf-life product technology and expanded it through a joint venture relationship formed in 2001. Aseptic technology creates shelf-stable products using a sterilization process which allows product storage for prolonged periods without refrigeration.While not specifically stated in the public documents reviewed, the information collected are puzzle pieces and connecting them allows a view into a technology royalty rate premium over a trademark royalty rate. The technology premium seems to be supported by the specialized production and packaging processes related to extending the shelf-life of food or for food to be stored without refrigeration until opened.In this case, a royalty rate technology premium of 1.5% for the Value-Added products is evident (3.0% shelf-stable less 1.5% refrigerated), resulting in a 50% premium. This premium, and its inverse 50% (1- 0.50) helps unbundle the composite royalty rate paid for the use of trademarks and technology.We now have two benchmark adjustments which can help to expand the number of royalty rates observations when addressing the value of a trademark. Our â€œTrademark Royalty Rates in Franchise Agreementsâ€ article noted that 44% of the composite franchise royalty rate relates to trademark. Combined with this Land Oâ€™ Lakes/Dean Foods observation, the benchmark adjustment ranges from 44% to 50%.Obviously, the benchmark adjustments also work to expand the number of observable royalty rates used to value technology. The range for technology is 50% to 56%. In other words, 56% (1- 0.44) relates to the other intangible property such as know-how and procedures to operate the business in a franchise agreement.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032562/000095013702001355/c66485ex10-11.txthttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032562/000095013402014427/c72859exv10w1.txthttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/931336/000093133619000007/df-20181231x10k.htmhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/27500/000095013403004627/d04227e10vk.txthttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/931336/000095013403004622/d03908e10vk.txthttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032562/000095013404004408/c83905e10vk.txthttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032562/000095013709002070/c50152e10vk.htmCopyrightÂ© AUS Consultants, Inc.----A Market Approach to Uncovering Intangible Property ValueValue Discovery--Value Discovery--Value Discovery--Value Discovery--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Aaron Dinin, PhDinEntrepreneur's Handbook--8HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Most all VR gloves on the market let people touch VR objects via vibrations or haptic feedback, and while they are better than nothing, they kind of limit the experience, like using a PS4 controller over time and having that feeling fade after prolonged use.The KIST engineers detail how they designed the VR glove in a paper titled, â€œPneumatic actuator and flexible piezoelectric sensor for soft virtual reality glove system,â€ which employs a series of sensors and soft silicone that generate force when grabbing or touching something in VR space. The glove manipulates a virtual hand in digital space using a set of piezoelectric sensors and soft pneumatic actuators.Those sensors, eleven in all, are placed on thumb, index, and middle finger, and when squeezed or touched, sends an electrical pulse to the silicone actuators. Those actuators then inflate with air, changing its shape depending on the amount of electrical current.The touching and movement data from the sensors is sent to an â€˜interface boardâ€™ housed on the forearm of the user and then passed on to a computer system that translates it into finger-joint angles and hand movements in VR. The userâ€™s brain is then â€˜trickedâ€™ into thinking they are holding or touching an object. Though the VR glove is currently in the prototype phase, the engineers state that the device could be linked to any VR gaming engine for more immersive gameplay, or even for scientific experiments in a VR setting.----Cabe Atwell--3Cabe Atwell--1Cabe Atwell--2Cabe Atwell--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Avi Bar-ZeevinPredict--2Geno TechinAI Fundementals--1Unbecoming--768umair haqueinEudaimonia and Co--43Scott H.

It has been lightly edited and sources have been linked.During CBSâ€™ December 7, 1963 television broadcast of the annual 1963 Army-Navy football game, viewers were treated to the first use of instant replay when Army quarterback Rollie Stichwehâ€™s fourth-quarter touchdown run was replayed on-air at full speed. The concept was so novel at the time that play-by-play announcer Lindsey Nelson had to clarify what had just unfolded, stating the following: â€œThis is not live! Ladies and gentlemen, Army did not score again!â€Originally conceived by Tony Verna as a way to fill time in between snaps and show action taking place away from the ball, replay technology was expensive and limited to television in its earlier years. It was not until 1986 that the National Football League (NFL) became the first league to use replay to review and potentially overturn officialsâ€™ calls in-game. Even then, replay was discontinued in 1992 due to pace of play concerns before being reinstated in 1999.Since then, nearly every sport has incorporated instant replay into the game, often with extensive rules detailing the circumstances in which replay can be used and what criteria must be met for a call to be changed. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), replay is frequently used to determine which team last touched a ball before it went out of bounds, whether a foul was flagrant, and whether or not a shot beat the buzzer. Soccerâ€™s video assistant referee (VAR) technology can help decide among other things whether or not a goal was offsides and if a penalty should be awarded for a possible foul. Tennis players can make real-time challenges as to whether a ball was in or out. The NFL has recently expanded its use of replay, as sports increasingly do, to now incorporate pass interference decisions. But while all this added review has certainly made officiating more accurate, has it really succeeded in improving sport as a whole?While the use of instant replay in sports has expanded rapidly in the past two decades, its negative consequences, including a less entertaining product, inviting a system that treats some calls as more important than others and harming the social contract between players and officials have caused more harm than good to sports. To remedy this, instant replay should be banned from sports.An examination of ethical philosophies can provide evidence supporting the elimination of instant replay. To start, consider the consequentialist philosophy of utilitarianism. As Brian Boone writes in his book Ethics 101, â€œat its most basic level, utilitarianism states that if one can increase the overall happiness of the worldâ€¦, then one should.â€ This can be achieved by acting in ways that maximize pleasure while minimizing pain. It is additionally important to note that utilitarians â€œdonâ€™t care who gains, as long as there is gain in some wayâ€, resulting in what Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, would famously call â€œthe greatest happiness for the greatest number.â€Applied to a sporting context, one must first determine those affected by instant replay in sports. Certainly, the players, coaches, and referees are impacted, but particularly at the highest levels of sport, fans vastly outnumber direct participants in the sporting activity. In many sports leagues, events are regularly attended by tens of thousands and watched on television by millions. This poses the question, â€œdoes instant replay improve the sports viewing experience?â€Ultimately, that answer is dependent on the context of the replay. Going back to the original uses of instant replay, to add entertainment during stoppages of play and allow the viewer to see different angles and parts of the game that may be missed the first time around, the technology has been successful. However, in the context that modern replay is discussed, concerning its abilities to overturn the decision of game officials, it has not. The reasoning why stems from the reason the NFL removed replay between 1992 and 1999 â€” pace of play. In an attempt to make sure calls are made correctly in critical game situations, replay has added numerous and oftentimes lengthy review periods to sports, which detract from the action. As Will Leitch put it, â€œweâ€™ve eagerly added an extra ten minutes or so every game where absolutely nothing is happening.â€ Adding to this trouble is that calls are most frequently reviewed at the end of games, where stakes and tensions are highest. Instant replay tapers the excitement of these situations leaving fans to become frustrated.A related and unforeseen consequence of these review periods is that the anticipation of review itself can make the on-field product less exciting by limiting the perceived impact of outcomes. Writing for the New York Times, Jay Caspian Kang explains that when a game-winning shot is made or a late-game touchdown is scored, â€œwe pause or at least hiccup in our response to make sure that the whole thing wonâ€™t be overturned upon review.â€ With replay, the absolute joy experienced in one of these situations has to be temporarily put on pause as fans hold their breath hoping their teamâ€™s receiver fulfilled the notoriously confusing requirements for a completed catch. The prospect of replay itself lingers in the back of a fanâ€™s mind, limiting their overall enjoyment.Replay also has negative consequences on those actively participating in sports. Having to frequently stop play to check the tapes can take a player out of their rhythm and quash any momentum. It can also lead to players badgering officials, complaining about calls and persistently pushing for review. Getting rid of replay might result in a few more missed calls here and there, making officiating in sports slightly less accurate, but it wouldnâ€™t make anything less fair. Long term, each team would still benefit and suffer from the same amount of errors, while the game would be more entertaining.Another useful perspective in adjudicating instant replay is that of deontology. Often presented as an opposite view to utilitarianism, the philosophy associated with Immanuel Kant starts with the concept of the categorical imperative which, according to Boone, states that â€œmorality, or the idea of morality, is a natural outgrowth of rational thinkingâ€, meaning that with a strict application of principles, one can evaluate the morality of any action.For Kant, these two major principles are the formula of the universal law of nature, and the humanity formula. The universal law of nature essentially states that before performing an action, one should â€œask what would happen if that action was a universal rule.â€ So, since it would not be advisable for every person to steal whenever one wanted something, an individual should not choose to steal.The humanity formula advises one to â€œact in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a mean, but always at the same time as an end.â€ Simplified, this means to recognize the humanity in other people rather than just using them to pursue oneâ€™s own goals.First, consider how the universal law of nature might be applied to instant replay. There is no sport where every single call is reviewed. Such a rule would render sports practically unplayable, as stoppages would occur at every important action. Since every call cannot and should not be reviewed, then it holds true that no calls should be reviewed.Looking at this from a slightly different viewpoint, sports have rules which determine when a play can be reviewed. In the NBA, for example, certain calls can only be reviewed in the last two minutes of a game. Other sports give players or teams a limited number of challenges to use at their discretion. Doing so designates some calls as more important than others, where a deontologist would see all calls as equal.While not directly, instant replay can also be argued to violate the harm principle by encouraging players and fans to use inappropriate behavior towards referees, complaining about calls, arguing for review, and even exaggerating contact in an attempt to draw fouls. These actions use referees as a means to an end of being awarded advantages and treat referees in a way unique to their profession.Of course, no argument is without its counters, and for the elimination of replay from sports, Aristotleâ€™s concept of the golden mean is one of these potential counterarguments. According to the Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, humans should strive to the quality of eudaimonia, which can be translated to mean â€œflourishingâ€. Aristotle believed that â€œevery ethical virtue is a condition intermediateâ€¦between two states, one involving excess, and the other deficiencyâ€, and by trying to find the optimal midpoint between these extremes and act in that manner, people can approach eudaimonia. The excess of courage would be rashness, acting without thinking, while the deficient state would be cowardice, being too fearful to act at all.More generally, the golden mean suggests not to act in an extreme way, and instead opt for balance. Getting rid of instant replay entirely would certainly be an extreme solution to the problem and represent a total deficiency. On the flip side, reviewing every single call would be excessive. Instead, sports should seek a balance, using the technological capabilities of replay to make sure important calls are correct without going overboard.This ideal balance is difficult to achieve and will be different for each sport due to differences in rules and structure, but tennis serves as a good example of how it can be done successfully. Players are given a limited amount of challenges (three incorrect challenges per set), and the incredible precision of the Hawk-Eye technology means that reviews are done quickly and accurately.As fans will inevitably see replays on television, it can be argued that replay is necessary to maintain belief in the integrity of the game. The NBA has embraced the heavy scrutiny its officials are under by publishing reports reviewing each officiating decision in the last two minutes of close games. Adam Silver described his reasoning to Michael Lewis this way: â€œif people donâ€™t believe that the league office is unbiased and that the officials are unbiased, youâ€™re going to have a problem, regardless of the accuracy of the calls. You cannot turn the clock back on transparency.â€But what about when the prevalence of replay undermines the role of officials in the first place? Social contract theory, popularized by Thomas Hobbes, is a practical philosophy that attempts to explain why people submit themselves to rule. Hobbes offers that â€œgiven that men are naturally self-interested, yet they are rational, they will choose to submit to the authority of a Sovereign in order to be able to live in a civil society, which is conducive to their own interests.â€ In other words, some level of higher control is necessary for things to run smoothly.Instant replay is a relatively new development over the history of sports. Before any replay existed, referees were put in charge of officiating games, as giving these unbiased parties total control was deemed the most efficient way of doing things. This created a social contract which successful in managing sports for generations.However, instant replay has somewhat severed this contract by taking control out of the refereesâ€™ hands and putting increased scrutiny on their work. This has led to unrealistic standards of perfection when referees, due to the scrutiny, are likely more accurate than ever before. Yet, the expectation of perfection fuels accusations of favoritism and emboldens players, giving them the right to be much more talkative.Perhaps the NBA has made this worse by creating a replay center in Secaucus, New Jersey tasked with providing the on-court referees with the best angles possible for aid in making replay decisions, an outcome that has not gone unnoticed by Lewis.â€œThe refs used to insist on their authority. At any rate, everyone agreed there was no better way to ensure the fairness of the game than to let the ref play God. The replay center is an admission the ref is not God â€” that he makes mistakes.â€In an unforeseen twist, by taking steps to make sure NBA games are officiated more correctly than ever before, the league has only weakened the authority of those in charge.While eliminating instant replay from sports would be an extreme and controversial decision, it would be the right one. For most of their history, sports have existed without instant replay yet were able to be successful through the social contract formed with referees. The adoption of instant replay has slowed down sports â€” particularly the end of games â€” considerably, diminishing the excitement of what should be tense situations. Additionally, the way that replay currently operates, only reviewing some calls, means some plays are incorrectly viewed as more valuable than others. Since it would be impractical to review every single call, the logical move would be to review none, putting an end to instant replay.----2Top Level SportsProfessional sports researcher.

Children as young as three years old are already familiar with how to get from the homepage to the Netflix app and most â€œtweensâ€ and teenagers know their selfie lighting perfectly along with their favorite Snapchat filter.Screen time is an unavoidable reality in modern parenting and although it comes with drawbacks it doesnâ€™t have to be all bad. Educational apps and TV (in moderation) can help develop the brain and itâ€™s also an easy way to keep your child out of the kitchen when youâ€™re making dinner. Reader beware!Studies have shown the dangers of excessive digital use in children.What are some of the primary concerns around raising digital natives? Letâ€™s take a look at the statistics from the parentâ€™s perspective.Social media is ever-present in todayâ€™s world. Youâ€™re on it, your friends are on it, maybe even your parents, but most notably your children are.Parents often begin to give children a some online independence around the ages of eight to twelve.This is usually when parents give their kids their own smartphone or allow them to make social media profiles.The C.S. Mott Childrenâ€™s Hospital conducted a survey called â€œNational Poll on Childrenâ€™s Healthâ€ aiming to know how parents feel about their â€œtweensâ€ using social media. The results of poll leaned towards the negative side, with94% of parents agreeing social media makes it easier for their kids to get into trouble.But an impressive61% believed that social media accounts aided them in keeping track of their childrenand keeping them out of trouble.â€œThe tween stage brings new challenges for parents as they often must balance their childâ€™s desire for more freedom and independence with supervision. Itâ€™s not an easy balancing act,â€ stated Sarah Clark, the co-director of the poll. â€œEstablishing family rules around the use of social media, and discussing the reasons for those rules, is an important part of parenting tweens.â€ She added.Parents need to find a balance between giving independence and appropriate supervision without being negligent or overbearing. Explaining the reasoning behind your rules to your kids is a good way to help them understand and follow them.Because of the introduction of screens into childhood, kids spend a lot less time playing outside. If you feel like your child is spending a lot of time on gadgets youâ€™re not a bad parent and youâ€™re also not alone.According to the GoGo Squeez survey conducted by Edelman Intelligence in 2018,76% of US parents say their kids engage in more screen time than theyâ€™d likeand to minimize screen time73% of the respondents admitted to scheduling structured activitiesfor their kids.Researchers have come up with mixed results in their studies concerning the effect of screen time on the developing brains of children. This is because brain scans are merely glimpses of how the brain works as itâ€™s ever-changing and continuously growing.However, a study that was published in the Preventive Medicine Reports journal found that young people who spend seven or more hours a day on screens aretwice as likely to be diagnosed with depression and anxietyas opposed to those who only have an hour of screen time daily.The American Heart Association issued ascientific statementaffirming that elevated screen time is associated with sedentary behavior which leads to obesity and ultimately heart problems in children and adolescents. To combat this, the AHA recommends parents limit screen time for kids to a maximum oftwo hours per dayandone hour for children ages two to five.According to a poll carried out by Wakefield Research for Comcast,76% of parents said their kids are more addicted to their digital devices than to candy.Thatâ€™s becausedigital screens really ARE addictive.Dopamine, the neurotransmitter responsible for the feeling of pleasure and satisfaction, is released by the stimulation from electronics. Ever wondered why watching cat videos is so satisfying? This is the reason.But in children, the effect is worse becausetheir brains are not developed enough for them to feel satisfied in small doses.Thatâ€™s why young kids can spend hours and hours watching videos or playing games on smartphones and tablets.â€œScreen time â€” particularly the interactive kind â€” acts as a stimulant, not unlike caffeine, amphetamines, or cocaine.â€ Said Dr. Victoria L. Dunckley, an integrative child psychiatrist.According to a new study conducted by global communications consultancy Ketchum,76% of parents said that they are concerned about new developments in technologyaffecting their childâ€™s privacy and identity.Parents are right to be worried because manyteenagers share an excessive amount of personal information online. According to the joint survey by Pew Research Center and the Berkman Center for Internet Society:Parental controls can help but not for long. According to Pew Research Center,67% of teenagers know how to hide what they do online from their parents and 10% know how to unlock parental controls soon after setup.Parents of digital natives should educate children about the dangers of social networking to protect them from harm.The issue of children being addicted to media is not a new concern. Parents used to complain about children are spending too much time listening to the radio. Then the radio evolved into the television and now, it has changed once again into computers and smartphones.The handheld aspect of the tablet and smartphone has in turn made monitoring screen time or time interacting with the media much more difficult to control. In fact, in a poll by Morning Consult,69% of parents agreed that the media children are exposed to these days is more harmful than the media in the past.No matter what type of media your children are consuming, it is important to reduce unsupervised media use and to encourage non-screen activities. Waiting till a later age to introduce electronics into your childâ€™s life (as hard as it may be) will also reduce the amount they rely on it and feel as though they need technology. Finally, children learn by example. By monitoring your own screen time and setting a standard for a healthy amount of time on your own devices youâ€™ll help your children to be more on board with rules you set about their time using tech.Is Taking Away your Childâ€™s Phone the Best SolutionHow to Monitor Your Childâ€™s Screen TimeSetting Up Parental Controls On Digital DevicesOriginally appeared on www.goboldfish.com----Delfina joined BOLDFISH in November â€™18.

BunlarÄ±n hiÃ§biri yenilmez ve en ideal deÄŸildir, Ã§Ã¼nkÃ¼ her yÃ¶ntemin belirli durumlar iÃ§in hangi tekniÄŸin en uygun olduÄŸunu belirlemeden Ã¶nce iyice keÅŸfedilmesi gereken Ã§eÅŸitli Ã¶zellikleri vardÄ±r.Bunun klasik anlamda bir Ã§oklu imza olmadÄ±ÄŸÄ±nÄ±, bununla birlikte, burada diÄŸer ÅŸifreleme Ã§oklu imza formatlarÄ± ile karÅŸÄ±laÅŸtÄ±rmak Ã¼zere varolduÄŸunu sÃ¶yleyelim.Burada, Ã¶zel anahtarÄ± yeniden oluÅŸturmak iÃ§in M kiÅŸiden N tanesinin onayÄ±nÄ±/imzasÄ±nÄ± gerektiren Ã¶zel bir anahtar kullanÄ±lÄ±r. Bu ÅŸema genellikle anahtar kurtarma iÅŸlemi iÃ§in kullanÄ±lÄ±r, eÄŸer bir kullanÄ±cÄ± Ã¶zel anahtarÄ± kaybederse, kullanÄ±cÄ±nÄ±n Ã§eÅŸitli arkadaÅŸlara daÄŸÄ±ttÄ±ÄŸÄ± parÃ§alarÄ± kullanarak orijinal anahtarÄ± yeniden oluÅŸturmak mÃ¼mkÃ¼ndÃ¼r.

AyrÄ±ca, bireysel shard sahipleri hangi iÅŸlemin imzalanacaÄŸÄ±nÄ± sÃ¶ylemezler, tek saÄŸladÄ±klarÄ± shardâ€™dÄ±r.

Ã–yleyse, eÄŸer Aliceâ€™in ilk 10 sÄ±rrÄ± varsa ve gizli tutucusu Bob ise, Alice, 9 sÄ±rrÄ± yeniden oluÅŸturabilir ve geri kalan gÃ¼venilir partilere verebilir (umarÄ±m eski paylarÄ±nÄ± yok eder, Bobâ€™un payÄ±nÄ± boÅŸa Ã§Ä±karÄ±r).Bitcoin (SplitKey) ve Ethereum iÃ§in bazÄ± kÃ¼tÃ¼phaneler var, ancak daha Ã§ok anahtar kurtarma sistemleri olarak Ã§alÄ±ÅŸÄ±yorlar.ECDSA eÅŸiÄŸinde, bir Ã¶n / mevcut Ã¶zel anahtarÄ±n bulunduÄŸu Shamirâ€™in kÄ±rÄ±lganlÄ±ÄŸÄ±nÄ± gideririz.

Bu, hiÃ§bir partinin asla gerÃ§ek Ã¶zel anahtarÄ± Ã¶ÄŸrenmemesini saÄŸlar. Bu inÅŸaattan Ã¶nce anahtar Ã¼retimi yalnÄ±zca gÃ¼venilir bir satÄ±cÄ± kullanmakta pratik olacaktÄ±r, Ã§Ã¼nkÃ¼ hesaplama zamanÄ± ikiden bÃ¼yÃ¼k partiler iÃ§in Ã§ok fazla olacaktÄ±r.Keep Network ve Kzen Networks tarafÄ±ndan yapÄ±lan ECDSA eÅŸiklerinin nasÄ±l Ã§alÄ±ÅŸtÄ±klarÄ±na bir gÃ¶z atÄ±n!ECDSA ile ilgili bir sorun, imza algoritmasÄ±nÄ±n karmaÅŸÄ±klÄ±klarÄ±ndan dolayÄ± eÅŸik imzalarÄ±nÄ±n sÃ¼reÃ§ almasÄ±dÄ±r.

Anahtar sayÄ±sÄ±na doÄŸrusal olarak bÃ¼yÃ¼yen P2SH kullanmak yerine, imza birleÅŸtirme ile sabit boyutlu imzalara izin verilir. DoÄŸrulayÄ±cÄ±nÄ±n, imzalayanlarÄ±n ortak anahtarlarÄ±nÄ± bilmesi gerekmez ki bu da gizliliÄŸi arttÄ±rÄ±r. Blockstream, bu tekniÄŸin Bitcoinâ€™de Ã¶ncÃ¼ olmasÄ±na yardÄ±m ediyor.Schnorrâ€™da onaylamayÄ± Ã§eÅŸitli takaslarla uygulamanÄ±n birkaÃ§ yolu vardÄ±r, bazÄ± programlarda kullanÄ±cÄ±lar kendi anahtarlarÄ±nÄ± saÄŸlarlar, bazÄ±larÄ±nda DKG iÅŸleminin yapÄ±lmasÄ± gerekir. Genel olarak, anahtar oluÅŸturma ve iÅŸlem imzalama iÃ§in en az bir iletiÅŸim turu vardÄ±r, iÅŸlem imzalama aynÄ± zamanda bÃ¼yÃ¼k bir m veya n ile iyi Ã¶lÃ§eklenemez.Bohen-Lynn-Shacham imzasÄ±nÄ±n kÄ±sa hali olan BLS, bÃ¼yÃ¼k imza setleri iÃ§in Ã§ok iyi Ã§alÄ±ÅŸÄ±yor. Yani, kurulum ve imzalama zamanlarÄ±nda neredeyse hiÃ§bir fark olmadan, 10 ve 1000 tane katÄ±lÄ±mcÄ± iÃ§in Ã§ok verimli sonuÃ§lara ulaÅŸabilirsiniz. Kurulum aÅŸamasÄ± iÃ§in yapÄ±lmasÄ± gereken tek ÅŸey, her bir Ã¶zel anahtar iÃ§in Ã¼yelik anahtarlarÄ± oluÅŸturmaktÄ±r, bu sadece bir tur iletiÅŸim gerektirir. KullanÄ±cÄ±lar kendi Ã¶zel anahtarlarÄ±nÄ± saÄŸladÄ±klarÄ± iÃ§in, Ã§oklu anahtarlarÄ±n kolay yÃ¶netimi iÃ§in HD Derivation gibi teknikleri kullanmak mÃ¼mkÃ¼ndÃ¼r. KullanÄ±cÄ±lar iÅŸlemleri Ã§evrimdÄ±ÅŸÄ± olarak imzalarlar ve tek bir toplayÄ±cÄ± imzalarÄ± ekler ve gÃ¶nderir.Ãœyelik anahtarlarÄ±nÄ± kullanan bu Ã¶zel yapÄ± oldukÃ§a yenidir, baÅŸka bir yÃ¶ntem ise Shamirâ€™in Gizli PaylaÅŸÄ±mÄ±nÄ± kullanmaktÄ±r (Dfinity ve Dash tarafÄ±ndan kullanÄ±lÄ±r), ancak gÃ¼venilir bir satÄ±cÄ± veya DKG gereklidir. BLSâ€™nin bir dezavantajÄ±, optimal bir eÅŸleÅŸmenin bulunmasÄ±nÄ±n yetersiz olduÄŸu yabancÄ± bir ortamda iÅŸliyor, yani imza doÄŸrulamasÄ± yavaÅŸ, hatta ECDSAâ€™dan daha yavaÅŸ.Bu teknikleri belli bir mesafeden incelerken, bir kÄ±smÄ±nÄ±n diÄŸerlerinden daha Ã¼stÃ¼n olduÄŸu gÃ¶rÃ¼lmektedir.

While doctors near her home in the United Kingdom managed to save her life, they couldnâ€™t save her hands. As a toddler she learned to adapt to life without them, then as time went on, using a range of different prostheses.Prosthetic limbs have been around almost as long as humans have. Through illness, accident or bad luck, thereâ€™s been a need for prosthetic arms, legs, feet and hands for millennia. The oldest known example is a wooden big toe, discovered strapped to a 3,000-year-old Egyptian mummyâ€™s foot in a tomb at Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, on the arid west bank at Thebes. The device is surprisingly advanced: its carved toenail and rounded bottom would have helped the wearer maintain their balance. But it was simply an appendage, without any functionality. And that was the full extent of prosthetics, in a state of near-stasis, for thousands of years.War became a key driver for many of the more recent innovations in prosthetics: 40,000 British servicemen lost limbs in the First World War, and so Queen Maryâ€™s Hospital in Roehampton, which opened its doors in 1939, became an engine for prosthetics in Britain during and in the aftermath of the second global conflict. Rather than simply looking passable, the limbs developed here had a purpose: to be useful and restore some function to those who were â€œlimb differentâ€ (meaning they had an amputation of some sort). But the technology was â€” and until recently still remained â€” in its infancy.Standard prosthetics are often bulky, heavy and visually unappealing, falling into a flesh-coloured uncanny valley. Theyâ€™re also expensive â€” one child-sized hand cost the Lockey family Â£36,000. Rather than being something that helps limb different people improve their mobility, such limbs can be a mill stone, singling them out as being not quite the same as everyone else.A team of 17 engineers, designers, coders and biomedical experts based in three boxy offices in a sprawling start-up accelerator space at the University of the West of England, Bristol, decided to celebrate their difference rather than try and mimic real skin and real limbs. The company â€” Open Bionics â€” develops comparatively affordable (around Â£8,000 to Â£9,000) assistive devices that sit at the cutting edge of technology, pushing the boundaries of what people with limb difference can really do â€” and most importantly, look nothing like the run-of-the-mill prostheses youâ€™re imagining.Open Bionics has a traditional, pinky-brown prosthetic limb in its offices, which sits in stark contrast to their new sleek, lightweight, consciously different design. They recently made their 100th â€œHero Armâ€ and have nearly 30 customers dotted around the country, with a first fitting planned abroad â€” in Spain â€” in November. The company will be expanding into Europe and the United States in 2019, heralding a new era for prostheses.â€œWithin the industry thereâ€™s been a revolution,â€ says Adam Dowdeswell, Open Bionicsâ€™ product manager. â€œAs technology has progressed and developed, whatâ€™s important to a user has come to the forefront. Rather than just: â€˜Letâ€™s try and replicate somethingâ€™, thereâ€™s been a movement in the consideration of mental health over the last few decades.â€While the improved physical movement the arm provides is the most obvious visual result, Joel Gibbard, co-founder of the company, explains that thereâ€™s a bigger impact that canâ€™t be seen. â€œWe usually hear it from the parents,â€ he says, settling down to a meeting with staff. â€œIt has more of a psychological impact than we expected. People feel more confident.â€Joel started tinkering with robotic hands at the age of 17, a decade after his first dalliance with engineering: making a robot to do the cleaning chores his parents had set him. His final-year university degree project was to build a 3D-printed robotic hand â€” a challenge his lecturers said wouldnâ€™t be possible. He established Open Bionics with co-founder Samantha Payne in 2014. In the years since Joel first began building his robotic hand, attitudes towards limb difference have changed almost as rapidly as the technology underpinning it. Weâ€™ve had successive Paralympics, kickstarted by the welcome London gave the worldâ€™s best athletes in 2012. Prince Harryâ€™s Invictus Games actually took place the same year that Open Bionics was founded.â€œPrince Harryâ€™s Invictus Games actually took place the same year that Open Bionics was founded.â€Ever increasing abilities and feats by competitors in subsequent Paralympics have helped to combat the perceived wisdom that limb difference is a disability. And Open Bionics donâ€™t like using the term at all.â€œI donâ€™t like using disability because I donâ€™t think the limb differences we work with are,â€ explains Adam. â€œThe way we see the world going is a future where human augmentation isnâ€™t something to be scared of,â€ says a member of the Open Bionics team.In a time when many of us are buying wearable tech and companies are looking for ways to reduce injuries and improve performance by equipping workers with exoskeletons; whatâ€™s a robotic arm between friends?â€œPeopleâ€™s perceptions about limb difference have changed and are still changing,â€ says Adam. â€œSome people want to mimic the skin colour and have it not be an obvious thing, but some people say: â€˜No, Iâ€™m proud. This is different, it looks cool. It expresses me.â€™ To have that choice has proven quite important to people.â€Case in point: Tilly Lockey, now 13, who wears her two Hero Arms with pride. She has her signature written in a rolling cursive script on each arm. Wearing a â€˜Girls Rockâ€™ T-shirt she looks like Iron Man.â€œFor her, itâ€™s a fashion statement and a confidence thing,â€ says Adam. â€œPeople come up to her and say: â€˜Oh my god, your arms â€” I want them.â€™â€Tilly is not alone: around two million people in the United States are limb different, with the number expected to double by 2050. In the United Kingdom, 8,500 amputation surgeries are carried out every year, a number that has increased significantly in recent years. There are no reliable statistics for the current number of limb different people in the country since the National Amputee Statistical Database, which had tracked numbers in the UK, closed in 2010. It was replaced by a project tied to the University of Salford, Manchester, which has not reported numbers since 2012.Everyone with limb differences has a unique story about how they came to rely on prostheses, but they all want to be recognised for who they are and what they have, rather than who they arenâ€™t and what they lack.The Open Bionics offices are in a state of flux, undergoing significant work to streamline the production process, with boxes in odd places and newly printed labels slapped onto desks to denote their future purpose. Ad hoc meetings are held at a small, circular table in the corner of the main open plan office, just a few yards from a foosball table whose players have the 3D-printed heads of a corresponding employee â€” plus a few customers. It is an office where everyone seems to be constantly moving and working.As are the 3D printers. In the corner of one office is a bank of 10 3D printers, whirring and beeping like the background of a sci-fi movie, spewing out parts for Open Bionicsâ€™ Hero Arm. Each of the printers has been christened by the engineer who built it, which is daubed on a nearby whiteboard. Thereâ€™s R2-D2, C-3PO and BB-8 â€” named after the Star Wars droids â€” and EVE, after the Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator in WALL-E. Thereâ€™s also Matilda, named by Steve Wood, a mechanical engineer at Open Bionics who competed in the seventh series of Robot Wars with Gyrobot.And lying on a worktop, surrounded by gadgets and gizmos, is Dan Melvilleâ€™s right arm. Just as youâ€™d take your car in for a regular service, Danâ€™s arm â€” among the first the company designed back in 2014 â€” needed a wrist replacement.Open Bionicsâ€™ Hero Arms are made using 3D-printed components, motors and other tiny elements. Despite cramming massive amounts of hardware and software into the arms, theyâ€™re light. â€œWeight is super important,â€ says applications engineer Leigh Warren as he scrapes then snaps individual 3D-printed elements from a massive block fresh from the printer. â€œThe hands are usually around 350g, depending on the size. Then the arms differ too, but itâ€™s usually about 700g in total.â€â€œThe problem is that a limb different person might not be used to the weight of a prosthetic arm,â€ continues Paula Maddox, senior electronics engineer at Open Bionics. â€œTheyâ€™re used to a third of the weight of the arm, so getting used to the full weight again can take some time.â€ However, â€œweâ€™ve seen children pick it up, and within five or 10 minutes theyâ€™re used to it,â€ she adds. â€œItâ€™s incredible.â€Every arm is custom-made in the Bristol office, based on a plaster cast taken by a prosthetist at a prosthetic clinic, passing through almost the entire companyâ€™s hands before being shipped out to customers.What the Hero Arm offers wearers is a range of movements rarely seen in the world of prostheses. While itâ€™s not a one-to-one replica of the movement and ability of a human hand, itâ€™s closer than bulky carbon fibre or metal prongs can provide. The arm is powered by three or four motors, depending on the size of the hand attachment, located roughly in line with and parallel to each finger. The motors â€” attached to a printed circuit board (PCB), and capped with infrared encoders and receivers, masked by spinning, fan-like devices that chop up an infrared beamâ€™s signal to help the PCB decipher where each finger is at any one point â€” power nuts to which two individual millimetre-thick nylon â€œtendonsâ€ are strung, reaching out from the centre of the hand to each finger.Further up the plastic 3D-printed sleeve enclosing the remaining limb, there are sensors no bigger than the head of a drawing pin that are triggered by the contraction of muscles. The sensors pick up on the electromyographic signals the muscles generate and feed them down to the PCB, where theyâ€™re translated into different movements of the fingers, providing preprogrammed grips that replicate the most useful ways we use our fingers and hands.And things are always changing at Open Bionics. Dan Melville is the companyâ€™s guinea pig, the one willing to test out new iterations of software and hardware. His Hero Arm, currently in for a quick tune-up on the wrist, is fitted with a thumb made from a harder, lighter coloured plastic whose points of articulation are far more ratchet-like than the current design. â€œItâ€™s been based on feedback that the hold on it is a bit springy, whereas this is more defined,â€ says Adam.In the main office space, where staff beaver away in front of massive computer screens, software engineer Olly McBride is tinkering further. â€œWeâ€™re constantly developing new things,â€ he says, scrolling through the roughly 30,000 lines of code that powers the hand alone. Olly is currently working on a new feature Open Bionics is keen to roll out to users after feedback: the ability to freeze the hand in one position easily.â€œIt was requested by one of our ambassadors,â€ explains Olly. â€œIf heâ€™s holding a pint at a gig, he doesnâ€™t want to be consciously thinking about tensing his muscles and not dropping the drink.â€ Itâ€™s a common concern among Hero Arm wearers: Tilly has a similar issue when playing on the Nintendo Wii at home. â€œShe used to turn the hand off to freeze it in place,â€ says Olly.Along one glassed wall of the offices where the Open Bionics team do most of their work, thereâ€™s a boxy white shelving unit. Itâ€™s adorned with trinkets and mementoes of this ground-breaking companyâ€™s young life. In the middle of the shelves, alongside the original, clunky hand that Joel Gibbard first designed all those years ago is a small section housing two colourful printed comic book covers â€” one red, one blue.Front and centre on both covers is a cartoon depiction of Tilly, one pouting, one beaming while brandishing her Hero Arm. One cover is titled â€œCaptain America and The Incredible Tillyâ€, while the other is altogether more straightforward. It reads â€œThe Bionic Womanâ€. As far as Open Bionics are concerned, Tilly is superhuman.Words: Chris Stokel-Walker, freelance journalistRead more stories from on: at on.dyson.co.uk and follow on: @dyson_on----Dyson on:UK-based freelancer for The Guardian, The Economist, BuzzFeed News, the BBC and more.

A woman eating takeout with her television. A smashed egg over a cutting board. What do these things have to do with each other? Youâ€™ll just have to see None for yourself (at the bottom of the article) to find out.Co-directed by Joel Willson and Chris Parish, None is a John Cage-inspired exploration of our relationship to technology and its effects on human relationships. Joel, a musician based in New Orleans, wanted to create something conceptual and a little â€˜weirdâ€™, while Chris, a filmmaker and photographer, wanted to find some sense of audience identification. Together, in collaboration with cinematographer Alex Moreno, the three created the first of what will surely be many more short film creations.Joel and Chris talk about getting started, the unique opportunity to perform the filmâ€™s score live before an audience and the importance of watching short films in community.Miniflix Interviewer: Joel and Chris, can you talk a little about yourselves and your artistic backgrounds?Joel Willson: Iâ€™m a musician from Baton Rouge who studied composition and violin at LSU (Louisiana State University) and has been involved with music projects ever since. I actually play in a band called Minos The Saint. The idea for the short film None was born out of an event hosted at the Baton Rouge Gallery called Movies on the Lawn. Minos The Saint performed a live score for the classic silent film Sunrise. Because of that, Iâ€™ve been wanting to get more involved with short films for awhile. So Iâ€™ve made the pivot from just doing live music to also collaborating with film people.Chris Parish: My background in the creative arts is all film-relatedâ€¦Iâ€™ve always had a yearning for the creative arts. Iâ€™m also from Baton Rouge and shoot photos and video for weddingsâ€¦this short film was something that was a little more out of the realm of what Iâ€™m used to. When Joel approached me and Alex [Moreno] about it and told me the premise of it, I was like, â€˜thatâ€™s super weird.â€™ Iâ€™m not used to super-weirdâ€¦but what led me to want to do it was that itâ€™d be challenging for me and outside my comfort zone.Miniflix: What came first â€” the idea for the story, or the music? What was the collaboration process like between yourselves?Joel: It was a very conceptually driven project. I had the idea that I wanted to be more involved from the very beginning of the process. Many times when people bring in music, itâ€™s kind of an after-thought. But I wanted to be involved with a project that had the music at the core, so it was very much infused from the beginning. Also, Iâ€™m a storyteller, mostly a songwriter, and wanted to take a shot at doing a story. Just practically, I knew Chris and Alex were awesome at photography and videography, and I knew I was strong in music, so I really wanted to do a project that used our strengths. As for who did what, I brought the original concept but after that it was the three of us the whole time working it out.Chris: Initially we all went to Zâ€™otz Cafe [in New Orleans]â€¦and knew we wanted to do something short film related. The next question was, â€˜what can we do?â€™ So we shot around a whole bunch of different ideas, ideas for future projects too, but when we left the meeting we decided to meet up again in a month and see where we were as far as additional ideas go. In that time, Joel had the idea for what would become None. He gave us the meat of it and then it was our job to see how we could make this a full course dinnerâ€¦M: Though the film is a commentary on the tech and digital era, you decide to represent it with â€œoutdatedâ€ technology or old, almost historical, filmic references. Why didnâ€™t you want to go with things like cell phones or modern computers as a representative? Was this an aesthetic choice (being vintage) or a thematic one as well?C: Alex had actually brought up the movie Her. A lot of that movieâ€™s themes and the styles that come from that movie are very retro but also not, you know? So color palette wise the movie Her was a big inspiration for us. Dealing with a lot of browns and oranges and muted colors. Because of that, our minds wandered stylistically towards retro stuff. I donâ€™t know if something like the tube television was what you specifically had in mind, Joel, or if it was more a matter of the style?J: It definitely came more out of the matter of style. Just the way that I think as an artistâ€¦ Iâ€™m a history buff. I know art styles and musical styles and futuristic stuffâ€¦and it all starts to blend in my head. I also liked the way we did it because when you use retro gear, it sometimes creates an emotion in people. It also creates this sense of timelessness, like youâ€™re not sure what time sheâ€™s inâ€¦it disrupts a time period.M: Can you talk more about whatâ€™s behind the juxtaposition between the woman and the man in the film? They each have their own particular lives going and seem to represent different things in the film.J: So the whole thing is conceptual and naming it None had to do with the idea that not everything has to have a specific meaning. But the overall theme has to do with the consumerism of relationships and the industrialization of the way we connect with each other. A theme in my writing and in my work is how technology is great but at the same time is preventing us from really connecting as humans. I didnâ€™t initially intend it to be a strong theme but it just ends up coming through in some of the stuff Iâ€™ve been working on. The whole thing about the vegetables in the filmâ€¦it sort of goes back to the retro scene of the refrigerator. On the TV at one point is the clip of a traditional family and theyâ€™re selling you this refrigerator so you put all your stuff in it. So then the smashing of the vegetables is representing that conflictâ€¦M: That totally makes sense. And the moments with the vegetables have this very tactile, earthy feel. Feels very human and corporeal.J: And thatâ€™s what we wanted to go for, but itâ€™s very conceptual so itâ€™s not a strong narrative about that.M: Right. Itâ€™s an association you can make emotionally.C: When we started talking about this, Joel and Alex were very John Cage-inspired and Iâ€™m more like â€˜Okay, but whatâ€™s the story? What are we doing here and what is the audience member going to feel from this?â€™ So we sat down and talked about the individual meanings behind each decision â€” like the vegetables being smashed and stuff â€” and what that was going to communicate. From the beginning of the short film, the woman character is very happy. But then you see the progression of her not being so happy â€” to the point that at the very end she turns the TV off. I think for me at least that was communicating her starting to kind of understand that being so consumerist driven and being so consumed by a TV isnâ€™t very rewarding.M: I agree. I think that arc really helps it from feeling random or unmotivated.J: And that was really the benefit of having a strong team. We each had different viewpoints and I think it really came together nice.M: Whatâ€™s one particular element or idea of the story that you ended up having to leave on the cutting room floor, or never even made it to production?J: If we had a couple more hours, there was some more details weâ€™d have added in, including with the mannequin.M: The mannequin? Can you talk more about that?J: Well, a mannequin was actually supposed to be attached with the TV as a head. That was the original concept. It was extremely challenging to figure out the TV on top of the mannequin. We ended up scrapping that. Just for practical reasons. We had a couple ideas, like Alex had some on the second day of shoot, but we just ran out of time. I feel like what we did produce was very effective. But there would have been more detail if weâ€™d had more time.C: Yeah, I think the TV thing was the main thing we had to cut. Also in the film thereâ€™s a scene of witches. We originally wanted to shoot that scene ourselves but we didnâ€™t. We obviously didnâ€™t have time to do that. We threw in the old-school retro witch scenes.J: One of the main themes when I was originally writing it came from Shakespeare. In Macbeth thereâ€™s â€œI dare do all that may become a man / Who dares do more is none.â€ That idea worked really well with the John Cage quote at the beginning of the film, which is why we called the film None. I found an original Macbeth opening with the witches (from Orson Wellesâ€™ Macbeth) and this very much, to me, played into an idea of a lucid dream. So the witches are kind of enchanting the audience. I also liked the rhythm of them throwing stuff into the cauldron; it was really musical.M: Iâ€™d actually like to talk more about the musical component. Was the soundtrack conceived before the concept, during production or after the edit? What was the timeline and process like for this soundtrack?J: The musical concepts I worked into the writing. The concepts and ideas I brought to the writing were very much like a song. So I had the outline of what I wanted the music to be scene-wise and I had that outline from the beginning. We also had a really talented editor work with us, Joseph Estrade. Heâ€™s also a musician, which is very helpful for this project.I sent him some scratches and he made the whole rough edit extremely musical. I had the themes played out on guitar and he made an edit with it. Once he gave me that back, I composed a score with parts for the different instruments: french horn, clarinet, flute, drums. In the score, some of the parts are written out and then some of it was meant to be improvised live. From a musical perspective, it was always very much meant to be a live experience.M: Can you both talk about your collaboration with Comfystone Films, and what led to the Monday Movie Mingle Screening in which you played None alongside a live performance of the score?J: I love the Movie Mingle; I love Josh Owen and Keith Hoffmann. I think what theyâ€™re doing is a great thing and the reason I think itâ€™s so great is because theyâ€™re focused on communityâ€¦ theyâ€™re creating a platform for people to meet each other and to celebrate the art weâ€™re making together.I met them last year. Iâ€™d already been doing four or five scores for other films just to collaborate with people. After we had the idea to work with each other, I approached Keith and said we were making a short film and weâ€™d love to have it be part of Monday Movie Mingle. I knew from the beginning that I wanted it to be an experience. Just doing a short film wasnâ€™t quite exciting enough, so I thought about how I could twist it just a little bit from a marketing perspective. Because people are going to remember this live performance. Theyâ€™re going to remember it for a really long time. A lot of the people there had never experienced anything like this. That concept itself isnâ€™t super unique, itâ€™s just the execution of it doesnâ€™t happen a lot of the time.They were both very supportive. Keith Hoffmann in particular was very involved with the production of None. He got us the TV and helped recruit our actress, Emily Russell. He connected me with some other people who wanted to help out. So they were very supportive.C: I met Josh over a year ago on a film. Iâ€™d hung out with them a few times in that environment, but Iâ€™d actually never met Keith before. He was very cool, came out and helped recruit others on set. Even before we shot, he came out and gave us some creative push-back on how we can do things in a very productive manner whenever we get on set. And the TV hook-up, of course.M: Besides the musical element, do you find the experience of watching a movie or TV show (personally) to benefit from being in a public place or in a live performance type setting? Why or why not?J: Yeah, and my opinion would be that itâ€™s extremely important because it promotes community, which is one of the themes in the film: isolation and that not being able to connect with people is bad. I feel like the live music part is fun because it brings a little bit of life to the experience, but just the fact of doing anything â€” even watching a movie where the score is pre-recorded â€” is viable because of the community aspect.C: I think that having the live music part of it, to me, communicates that this is more than just a film â€” this is an experience. It definitely benefits from being in a public space for people to watch it. Itâ€™ll also be on YouTube and thatâ€™ll be great, but I would definitely say that the audience members there at the Movie Mingle would find that the screening communicated itself as more than just a short film. Especially since the edit was centered around the score itself.A lot of times productions, short films or any type of films, have the cut made, edited and then you add the music. The whole concept is shot and made, and then you focus on the score. So just the concept of switching that around a little bit and saying that weâ€™re going to focus a lot more on the score itself, is very cool for me. The fact that we were able to do that live and have audience members react to that live was very, very cool.M: Any future short film projects in the works?J: Absolutely. We have a lot of things in the works. This was our first project as a team and I really was just trying this out to see if itâ€™d work or not. So as a core, me, Chris and Alex worked really well together. We have quite a few story ideas. Weâ€™ve talked about doing a few different things and one of the emotions, me and Chris were actually talking about this, was sad. We did weird this time and so Chris has a story idea that weâ€™d like to developâ€¦and who knows what else?C: So the sad thing is definitely my baby. Itâ€™s my passion project that weâ€™re going to start working on soon. The whole reason that we want to do this next one is that, same with None, we want to be able to invoke emotions in people. I feel like with film these days, in Hollywood and even on Netflix, a lot of stories that you watch have a beginning and an end and a climax and thereâ€™s always a resolution. Thatâ€™s great and always invokes a very happy feeling when the endingâ€™s great. But something thatâ€™s not explored as much is reality. Life doesnâ€™t always end like a Hollywood film. So this next one, something thatâ€™s sad and doesnâ€™t really have a resolution, is what Iâ€™d like to explore.To learn more about Comfystonefilmsâ€™ monthly Monday Movie Mingle short film event, go to https://www.facebook.com/comfystonefilms/.----MiniflixThe first online platform for award-winning short films.

The full body powered suit supported several physical actions of the user which required lifting and moving heavy loads. However, the technology was plagued with several issues such as being too expensive, heavy, rigid, and constrained in movement thus limiting the viability of market adoption. With further advances and modifications in processing speeds, batteries, sensors and materials, powered exoskeleton suits were made smaller and cheaper enabling the beginning of applications in other areas. Yet, by 2012 the technologyâ€™s primary use was restricted to medical rehabilitation where the costs for a â‚¬200,000 walking skeleton were justified.Fast forward 6 years and exoskeletons have undergone further technological modification and improvement. Rather than the expensive clunky full bodied powered suit of yesterday, exoskeletons now can offer partial, passive, or agile support with a decreased price tag. Though applications in both military and medical cases still dominate, new industries are starting to see the viability of exoskeletons. For instance, within manufacturing, Ford Motors has incorporated upper exoskeletons for workers performing repetitive motions in 15 plants worldwide, whereas Audi is testing small 3kg exoskeletons to reduce back injuries in two of their plants. In the case of Ford, since the adoption of their first exoskeletons, they have experienced a clear decline in the number of injuries, â€œup to 83% in some of the metricsâ€.Other big names such as Delta Air Lines, Caterpillar, and WÃ¼rth Industry have also raised their interest for industrial applications of exoskeletons, though there is not yet a substantial adoption of the technology. Future market assessment places the robotic exoskeleton market alone will reach $1.8 billion in 2025, up from $68 million in 2014. It is expected that the construction, manufacturing, demolition and logistics industries, although just a sliver of the market today, will represent almost half of the industry revenue within eight years.However, this expansion is not free of important challenges. Power-hungry exoskeletons are plugged into external power sources, which limits both range and movement. The creation of a compact power supply powerful enough to allow an exoskeleton to operate for extended periods of time is still required. Other challenges which have held back the increased adoption of exoskeletons include discomfort, weight, alignment with human anatomy, and reduced task efficiency due to irregular movement.Once these challenges are solved, exoskeleton uptake and proper use would be a valuable contribution to the European workforce in particular. As many as 44 million workers in the European Union (EU) are affected by workplace-related musculoskeletal disorders, representing a total annual cost to industry of more than $300 billion. Exoskeletons have the capacity to decrease the number of musculoskeletal injuries and increase the quality of life at work, thereby reducing costs for a company in the long run.For this reason, Bax & Company is leveraging its experience in smart industry and has launched EXSKALLERATE, a new initiative within the exoskeleton sphere. We aim to support increasing the adoption of exoskeletons in the North Sea Region of Europe within the manufacturing and construction industries. Additionally, the project will identify best practices in which improvements can be developed for the next generation.

En una de las lejanas reacciones luego del Big Bang, en el tercer planeta del Sistema Solar de la VÃ­a LÃ¡ctea, pensar en la presencia de vida es bÃ¡sicamente improbable. Sin embargo, luego de un proceso de pubertad, nuestro planeta comenzÃ³ a experimentar fuertes cambios hasta la generaciÃ³n de un proceso biolÃ³gico que comenzÃ³ a sintentizar cÃ©lulas que fueron evolucionando hacia seres vivos durante el perÃ­odo EdiacÃ¡rico. Luego de este proceso, hace 750 millones de aÃ±os, comenzaron a presentarse los primeros seres que emergieron desde las profundidades de nuestros ocÃ©anos hasta convertirse en las distintas criaturas que encontramos hoy en dÃ­a, incluidos los seres con la capacidad de devolver la sostenibilidad a nuestros ocÃ©anos y al planeta, los humanos.Si la vida comenzÃ³ en los ocÃ©anos, Â¿Por quÃ© nos sorprende que la clave de la sostenibilidad estÃ© en ellos?Los ocÃ©anos juegan un papel crucial a nuestras vidas. Nuestro planeta tierra estÃ¡ compuesto en un 70% por ocÃ©anos, y en toda la historia de la humanidad han jugado un papel fundamental en el desarrollo de las sociedades humanas. No en vano, las primeras grandes civilizaciones que existieron, se formaron cerca del mar. Y hoy en dÃ­a, los ocÃ©anos siguen formando parte fundamental de nuestras sociedades.Una de cada seis personas en el planeta depende directamente de los ingresos que pueden generar los ocÃ©anos, como la pesca. Sin embargo, las prÃ¡cticas desmedidas afectan de manera desproporcionada la biodiversidad. La OrganizaciÃ³n de las Naciones Unidas para la AlimentaciÃ³n y la Agricultura (FAO) ha estimado que el 57% de las reservas de pesca estÃ¡ completamente explotado y el otro 30% estÃ¡ sobre explotada, agotada o en perÃ­odo de recuperaciÃ³n. AdemÃ¡s de la explotaciÃ³n desproporcionada, se estima que la pesca con prÃ¡cticas ilegales, no reportada y no regulada (IUU, por sus siglas en inglÃ©s) es de 26 millones de toneladas de pescado anuales. Y como si no fuera suficiente la gran mayorÃ­a es capturado en zonas de pesca protegida (MPA, por sus siglas en inglÃ©s).Ante todo este escenario, la soluciÃ³n no pareciera tan sencilla. Es multi-dimensional. Ã‰sta debe tratarse desde diferentes planos, no puede ser tan sencillo como satanizar la pesca. Cuando se habla de sostenibilidad, se deben pensar en todos los aspectos tanto tÃ©cnicos, como sociales, ambientales y econÃ³micos. De la actividad pesquera se depende el sustento de muchas familias, y por ello se deben pensar en soluciones estratÃ©gicas para la generaciÃ³n de una soluciÃ³n sostenible. Donde se pueda seguir con el desarrollo de las comunidades pesqueras, pero con el menor impacto posible hacia el ecosistema.Y con esta visiÃ³n nace Remora Fishing Traceability. Trabajamos en el desarrollo de tecnologÃ­a que permita el manejo adecuado de los recursos pesqueros, potenciando las cadenas de valor y con ello el fomento de las prÃ¡cticas sostenibles. Pensar en el desarrollo de una Ãºnica soluciÃ³n integral para nuestros ocÃ©anos es imposible, pero nosotros sabemos que la tecnologÃ­a tambiÃ©n puede ser actor vital en este proceso. Por este motivo, este grupo de ingenier@s tic@s, Ã±oÃ±@s y apasiados por el ambiente seguimos trabajando en el desarrollo de soluciones de tecnologÃ­a que colaboren a mitigar la crisis climÃ¡tica..

Iâ€™ll take a bit of your time now, but I want to assure you I tried my best to make it worthwhile. Grab your tea or coffee and letâ€™s start.Iâ€™ve spent a huge portion of my last 5 years writing tests for javascript applications. I didnâ€™t get into testing through my own personal interest, but mainly because, letâ€™s sayâ€¦ others in the team were not that excited about itÂ :) And they had good reasons for that.However, It may sound a bit weird but I love testing for a long while now, I enjoy it and I think it started to like me back recently. In this article series Iâ€™d like to share a handbook that has taught me how to listen to my tests, what did my tests say about my code, and how they eventually made me a better developer.Please note that all the statements in this article series, if not referenced, are based on my own professional experience and my own observations. Iâ€™d be more than happy to hear your feedback, criticism, ideas, and experience.Testing is one of the most controversial and opinionated topics in the development world. Not because itâ€™s complicated, but because itâ€™s not standardized. I think this is also the main reason that makes testing painful for some of us.For instance, TC39 is doing a great job of standardizing Javascript. Thanks to their effort, in recent years Javascript became very powerful and a lot of fun to use. As a result, itâ€™s the most popular programming language on the planet. (Of course, also thanks to great Javascript community and especially V8 team to make mass adoption way easier.)Unfortunately, there are still no standard definitions for testing practices and there is no committee like TC39 who is working on it. If you google the test types, youâ€™ll see there are hundreds of them (and most of them make sense in their own way). Even unit tests â€” which I think you have heard the most â€” have several different definitions.Because of that, even in a small team in a small company, each developerâ€™s understanding of testing is different, so they write code and tests in their own way. Eventually, we end up having code that is not test friendly and having brittle tests that fail on the slightest change or randomly, or do not fail at all which is even scarier.Especially if there is a lack of team management, after a while, we may lose track of which parts of the product were tested and how they were tested. We may start questioning what was faked, what was tested with unit tests and what is part of integration tests. We might wonder if the code coverage still reflects the quality of the tests, etc.? The confidence in tests often decreases over time. At some point maintaining tests can become so exhausting or frustrating that you donâ€™t want to touch your own tests or even source code.(One could say there are other factors that also make testing painful, for instance, never-ending refactorings. But I would say, having to constantly refactor code is a sign of bad project planning and management. This does not only make testing painful but also the whole development journey. Therefore, I wonâ€™t be covering this subject in this series.)I think, because of the frictions I mentioned above, most developers are reluctant to write tests and avoid thinking about testing before they start to write their code.I hope we are going to change this situation in the near future, together!The definitions/rules/tips in this article series are mostly an aggregation and synthesis of a great number of articles, books, and talks which were written/given by amazing people in the Javascript and Open Source community, and a bit of my own development experience.This article series is my attempt to give you a new perspective on testing. Hopefully, in the end, we will have a common approach to test our products, we will have absolute confidence in our tests and maintaining tests will become way easier for us.Ok. Ready.

While the jury may still be out on Darwinism, humans have clearly evolved over the ages. As a species, we have evolved intellectually, socially and genetically. Interestingly, we are smaller than our ancestors were 100,000 years ago; and our brains are smaller.(1) Yet, technology is more advanced than ever before; and civilization continues to thrive. So whatâ€™s next for the human species? Where and how do we evolve from here?It may seem as though we have reached our genetic potential as a human species. But new bionic technology is blurring the lines between human and machine. Dan Melville, (pictured on the left), is one example of the future of bionics. Melville was born without a right hand and wore a prosthetic limb throughout his childhood. Thanks to the engineers at Open Bionics, Melville now has a bionic arm that can withstand a load of up to 8 kg.(2) Thanks to 3D printing and advanced software, bionic limbs are offering more accessibility to amputee patients.The next generation of prosthetic limbs (or bionics) rely on targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR); which was developed by Dr. Todd Kuiken at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.(3) Naturally, our limbs move in response to nerve signals sent from the brain. The brain sends electrical signals down the spine to peripheral nerves in the intended muscles. The peripheral nerves then send motor control signals, which allow for the contraction and relaxation of muscles. Sensory neurons present in the skin and limbs are responsible for sending feedback to the brain based on external stimuli. In the case of an amputee, the signals are cut off at the site of amputation. With TMR, surgeons can reattach nerves from the site of the amputation to neighboring muscles. The bionic limb can be attached at the site of amputation and interfaced with electrodes. Thus, when the patient thinks of moving, for example, their arm, the brain sends a signal to the motor neurons that contract muscles surrounding the amputation. Those muscles interface with the electrodes on the prosthetic limb and control the movement thereafter.Researchers and scientists from the Imperial College London and the University of GÃ¶ttingen are working to improve how patients interface with prosthetics. This team is aiming to improve on the current technology behind TMR. In their new bionic hand, the patientâ€™s intentions are picked up from electrical signals at the site of the amputation rather than neighboring muscle(s). The bionic hand relies on eight electrodes to pick up weak electrical signals from the stump of the amputee, which then sends signals to a miniature computer in the prosthetic. Professor Dario Farina, from Imperial Collegeâ€™s Department of Bioengineering stated, â€œWhen designing bionic limbs, our main goal is to let patients control them as naturally as though they were their biological limbs . This new technology takes us a step closer to achieving this.â€(4) With this technology, new prosthetics will be more responsive and feel more natural to the user.With the current state of bionics, or prosthetics, patients are not currently receiving any feedback from external stimuli. Bionics do not send feedback to the brain like normal limbs do. Therefore, the reflexive contractions experienced when touching a hot stove or bumping your knee, are not yet a feature with current bionic technology. However, as technology improves, the lines between human and machine get blurry.----Marcus Killebrew--Marcus Killebrew--Marcus Killebrew--Marcus Killebrew--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Everybody started to notice the wave is coming faster than ever. Your decadeâ€™s industrial revolution shorten to years thanks to technology. How humans revolutionized the world is truly on next the level compared to the whole of humankindâ€™s history.The shift is quite rough and shaky because it happened in a blink of an eye. Itâ€™s not that easy, especially for corporate to shift from â€œour success way cultureâ€ into the 4.0 culture.

Hoping they could overcome the old money in the new â€œdigital pondâ€, but itâ€™s quite vague really. Everyone needs a â€œhorseâ€ or tools to compete in the race. Yes, they are you, young entrepreneurs with big dreams trying to build the next Amazon and Facebook.Here is the thing, letâ€™s get real. Most of the successful digital entrepreneurs in every country have abundant experience in doing what they do and rich business connections. If you are trying to be the next Zuckerberg, relax, you wonâ€™t, unless you are lucky enough to be one in a million guy or have the 2 most important requirements mentioned above.Itâ€™s 2019 now and corporates are starting to adapt.

On a smaller scale, one may put celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, Brad Pitt, or Geoffrey Beene into consideration. These are just a handful among hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of entities that act selflessly to provide funds, goods, or services, and incite activities that echo remarkably around the world.Increased Doubts in CharitiesRecent years have proven, however, that peopleâ€™s trust in charities has been on the decline . Whyâ€™s that? People are sadly losing hope of their donations being delivered to whom they should be â€” and thatâ€™s a rightful point. While blockchain is still a relatively new technology, commonly being (mis)associated only with cryptocurrencies, its intrinsic values have already demonstrated plausible outcomes within the charity sphere.Transparency, immutability, trust â€” these are the core values blockchain can provide.Transparency? Check. Intermediaries? Cut. Corruption? Begone!Transparency, as the core aspect of blockchain, can be utilized in accepting and issuing donations more quickly and confidently. Through an immutable public ledger, donors can view and track how their donation is being used â€” from the transaction itself to its concrete usage. Considering blockchainâ€™s decentralized character, charities could secure their donations through cryptography, and more specifically, smart contracts.These would ensure that donors, recipients, and charities act in accordance with a pre-defined set of requirements, eliminating corruption and misconduct. Our team has recently released a describing the benefits blockchain technology brings worldwide. The team explains the technology and applications in layman terms and of course share their thoughts on the future. Check it out!In recent months, there have been many exhilarating talks of a new, game-changing asset that could impact the dynamically paced blockchain industry, called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Could there be a possible tie between NFTs and charity in a time to come? Think of it as a token which could only be redeemed for a single, specific service. Combined with all the features of trust and transparency blockchain offers, these could work as â€œcouponsâ€, possibly to be redeemed for specific types of groceries, clothes or other services. Additionally, NFTs could prove useful as prevention against explotation of donations by the recipients.As for intermediaries, banks and other financial institutions that offer third-party economic services for charities can often epitomize a lot of decrements to the money thatâ€™s being donated. Cutting back intermediaries that have control over a charityâ€™s funds can prove beneficial in the long run â€” avoiding middlemen that may financially manipulate and deviate from the charityâ€™s initial plans.And what about corruption? Regrettably enough, this displeasing aspect crops up in almost every area of life. This alone makes governments and other legal entities encourage anti-corruption measures that do not always perform efficiently. However, countries like Estonia and Russia have already put blockchain into practice to curb corruption , track voting and lower the chance of tax evasion. This proves that there are several ways blockchain could lead an effective fight against this unfavorable demeanor even in charity â€” by fully employing transparency and rightfully giving back trust to benefactors.A New Champion on The BlockYou mightâ€™ve caught a glimpse of our latest charity-based project, Token 4 Hope . It is safe to say that Token 4 Hope has successfully demonstrated blockchainâ€™s usability in the charity sector. The whole process went more than smoothly, with more than 10,000 EUR having been distributed among 47 households in Vienna, Austria. This is where we managed to apply the advanced features DCore can offer â€” speed, transparency and high-level security.At DECENT, weâ€™re all about solving real-world issues like lack of transparency and trust, which are so coveted in the charity industry today. Even outside the charity sector, DCore showcases many advantages that can be seen with our other projects and use cases.

However, there is one glaring issue with this new technology, and that is its lack of tactility.A key part of being a doctor is your examination skills. You need to be able to palpate for a mass, percuss for subtle changes in sound, and feel for increases in size as in measuring chest expansion. Even more so in surgery, where the slightest movement depends on the resistance of particular tissues. In the real world, these are not complex tactile things to do (relatively). But in a virtual world, recreating these interactions becomes incredibly difficult. But not impossible.There are multiple ways in which we could solve this issue, I think it is useful to split them into 3 modalities:Below I will discuss the theory behind these and current examples within each.Object driven is exactly that, using real world objects and mapping the VR object to it. This is by far the easiest of approaches to generate tactility in a VR world. Some may think this the same as augmented reality, but it is in fact the opposite, which has lead some to dub this â€˜augmented virtualityâ€™.By tracking real world objects, e.g. a ball, and mapping it to a virtual object of the same size, users interact with the real world object, but feel as if they are interacting with whatever object is projected into their virtual world. Far from the future, companies are already using this form of virtual reality to fully immerse users in a virtual world. An unlikely suspect is Disney, who have experimented with mapping a ball into a virtual reality landscape to play a game of catch in VR.It is likely that this form of tactility in virtual reality will be the earliest form of fully immersive VR. While still technically complex, it is the simplest form of relaying tactile information, as there is no need to simulate the touch, only map a virtual representation onto a real world object.As Iâ€™m sure you can see, this approach has limitations. Having to create real world objects for all items that you can interact with in a virtual world doesnâ€™t feel very â€˜virtualâ€™ at all, and in fact rather defeats the point. However, given the absence of any other method, it shows promise with small VR worlds that want to build fully immersive experiences.As oppose to object-driven, we begin to stray into the science fiction with the modality of peripheral sensation. First of all, what I mean by peripheral sensation is genuine sensation, without bypassing the users peripheral nervous system, but without the need to generate real world objects.This concept is similar to the â€˜Haptic suitâ€™ in the film Ready Player One. The haptic suit provides feedback to the user from experiences within a virtual world. An initial attempt at this suit is the Teslasuit (nothing to do with the electric car company).The Teslasuit is able to recreate the sensations of touch and even feelings of physical exertion and temperature. It does this using vibration and thermal components built into the suit. It also tracks important biometrics, including EEG and Galvanic Skin Response sensors making it able to detect the level of stress the users body is under. This comes in handy if you want bidirectional sensory behaviour, i.e. as well as the suit relaying sensory information to the user, the virtual world can adapt to biometric data taken from the user.This suit is a great start in creating peripheral sensation for virtual worlds, however, a key issue it doesnâ€™t address is interacting with objects within that space, i.e. the tossing of a ball we discussed earlier. Although you could feel the touch of the ball, you would not feel the pull of the ball due to gravity, i.e. its weight. Currently there is no suit capable of doing this, however, that does not mean this is not theoretically possible.One way I imagine this could be done is through the use of a smart material with an adaptable rigidity depending on an electric current. At rest (with no electricity passing through it), the material would be flexible, but if pressing against an immovable object, the material could become rigid restricting the users mobility, and therefore simulating an object, without the need for a real world surrogate to the virtual object. This type of material could also simulate moveable objects by slightly increasing its rigidity to simulate the weight of the object, but not so much as it completely restricted the users movement.As far as Iâ€™m aware, no such material exists with this behaviour (apart from muscle of course). But with such a material it would theoretically be possible to simulate virtual reality tactility without any need for real-world objects, transforming our ability to produce large immersive VR worlds.I must stress, as I begin to discuss the modality of central simulation, we are truly stepping into the realms of science fiction, though I will try and keep it grounded within scientific fact.First, a bit of science. The human nervous system is split into the peripheral and central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is all the the nerves going to and from your peripheries to your central nervous system. Your central nervous system is your brain and spinal cord.Central simulation describes the process of bypassing the patients peripheral nervous system entirely, manipulating the central nervous system directly to simulate experiences to the patient.Within the brain there lies the primary somatosensory cortex. This is the area of the brain that, although a massive oversimplification, processes sensory stimuli. This area is helpfully mapped out into the sensory homunculus, meaning a portion within it relates to the hand, another section the face, and so on. These sections go in order, from your feet going up your body to your head. Useful if you would like to recreate a sensation in only one location.Therefore, if we could activate this area of our brain in the appropriate way and with enough accuracy, we could simulate senses such as touch and temperature without need for these stimuli to be present in our environment. The advantages to this modality of sensory simulation are tremendous. We would be able to build entire virtual worlds, with complete sensory integration. Perhaps disturbingly, it would be difficult to tell if we were in a real world or not.Although this seems a distant prospect, companies are already attempting to build this form brain-machine interaction. Notably, Elon Musks start-up, NeuroLink, is attempting to design ultra-high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to allow a connection between humans and computers. It is unclear if they have made much progress with this, though most feel it is unlikely given the complexity to the challenge they are attempting to overcome.An issue with this method arises with how you restrict a users movement. For example, imagine there is a wall in your VR world. You push against it and a sensation of a wall is simulated within you somatosensory cortex â€” so you can feel the wall. But, there is no wall to actually push against, and so nothing to stop you moving â€˜throughâ€™ the wall, i.e. nothing to stop your movement. This would create a tremendous degree of sensory confusion, the effects of which we do not know.Virtual and augmented reality is likely to become a tremendous tool within healthcare and medicine within the coming years, however, it is hindered from creating truly immersive experiences due to its lack of sensory simulation â€” and while some senses are easy to fool, tactility is not one of them.If we are to use these tools in education and clinical settings, especially in areas such as surgery, where touch is integral, then novel approaches to recreating these experiences will need to be developed.

This is my 7th crowdfunding campaign on the Indiegogo platform and things have changed a lot since I first started using crowdfunding to launch new products. Here is what I learnedWhen I first started crowdfunding in 2012, campaigners had to drive almost all of their own traffic to their page. While the Indiegogo platform enabled some organic discovery it was very minor in comparison to the campaigner driving their own press and email traffic.Things have changed. In my latest campaign, Indiegogo has driven over 50% of the sales. This is a huge testament to the power of their email list, internal audience, and website discovery designs.Previously, press could drive a lot of traffic and sales to a campaign. In one of my first campaigns, TrackR wallet, a single press article drove nearly $50,000 in revenue. Over time, I saw that press articles drove less and less traffic & sales. This is mainly due to the fact that the press is running stories every 15 minutes or so on their website and doing a lot of short-form articles vs long-form articles that stay on their site for a few days. Also, there are just more places people get their news than in 2012 which has a dilutive effect on any press that has been earned.Media coverage is nice to have for helping boost legitimacy for the campaign and can help boost conversion rates a little bit. However, I would advise most campaigners to not worry about media & focus on social media.Email effectiveness has significantly deteriorated as a marketing channel with the advent of tabs in Gmail, the worldâ€™s most popular email service. This means that much of the sign-ups that you gather for your campaign wonâ€™t see the emails that you are sending them. There are further restrictions on rapidly growing email lists that prevent the kind of email tactics that made crowdfunding campaigns extremely successful in the early days.However, the rise of Facebook messenger and text messages have prevailed as extremely interesting channels where open rates are frequently 90% or more! A multi-channel approach to owned media is more critical than ever.The one thing that has mattered most to crowdfunding campaigns has been evangelism and that hasnâ€™t changed in 2019. People sharing the campaign is more important than ever and the idea of the crowd rallying behind a new idea is the core of crowdfunding.Itâ€™s been great to see the evolution of crowdfunding over the last 7 years. Crowdfunding has always been about individuals rallying behind new ideas that can change the world and itâ€™s great to see that idea become a reality.----Surfer, Kiter, 3x Entrepreneur in the consumer space.

Blanco, delivered at the 2018 Chicago-Kent Blockâ€¦",Courteney Kay,https://medium.com/@courteneykay,5,118,1,"Courteney KayFollowCoral--ListenShareIf youâ€™re operating a digital asset exchange (or an MSB more generally), chances are you know how dangerous it can be to misunderstand the regulatory environment.Here at Coral, we take compliance seriously â€” so, in case youâ€™re not in the loop about what it means to comply with regulatory requirements in the United States as a money transmitter, this article breaks down what you should know.First, itâ€™s important to note weâ€™ll be looking at compliance through a federal lens. Thereâ€™s undoubtedly more complexity at the state level- a topic weâ€™ll address in a future post.For now, weâ€™ll explore the federal regulatory landscape and steps needed to be compliant.Next, weâ€™ll take a look at the future of FinCEN, and finally, weâ€™ll discuss what options exist to help you prepare for compliance.The Watchdog:FinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, regulates KYC requirements for financial institutions, which encompasses anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorist financing (CTF). It serves two roles â€” issuing AML/CFT regulations and monitoring illicit financial activities occurring through the U.S. financial system.In the blockchain ecosystem, FinCEN is particularly important because many companies fall within the definition of a money services business (MSB), specifically money transmitters.Are you a money transmitter?If you touch or facilitate the transaction of cryptocurrencies, youâ€™re probably an MSB.In 2011, FinCEN changed the definition and regulations they use to regulate money service businesses. Thanks to these changes, â€œmoney transmissionâ€ now encompasses the acceptance and transmission of value that substitutes for currency. Translation: Virtual currency is a substitute and is now covered by MSB regulations.There are three steps MSBs must take to comply with regulatory requirements:According to FinCEN, their regulations applied to all transactions involving money transmission, including virtual currencies. This included transactions where individual parties exchanged â€œfiat and convertible virtual currencyâ€ in addition to those transactions from â€œone virtual currency to another.â€ They summed this up neatly by saying:â€œIn short, individuals and entities engaged in the business of accepting and transmitting physical currency or convertible virtual currency from one person to another or to another location are money transmitters subject to the AML/CFT requirements of the [Bank Secrecy Act] and its implementing regulations.â€For these reasons, being compliant often takes registering as a money transmitter and conducting an in-depth risk analysis of your platformâ€™s exposure to money laundering. Businesses need to implement an anti-money laundering program based upon an internal assessment of the risks, and also comply with FinCENâ€™s record keeping regulations* (see below.) From there, businesses need to file Currency Transaction Reports, Suspicious Activity Reports, an ensure that record keeping is extremely well documented and compliant with both the â€œFunds Travel Ruleâ€ and the â€œFunds Transfer Rule.â€So, what happens if your business doesnâ€™t proactively address these issues?A case study in the consequences of not complying: BTC-eOne example of these consequences can be seen with the case of BTC-e. The company was initially a virtual currency exchange platform. As a major player in the market, they had over 700,000 customers and, according to FinCEN, were â€œâ€¦associated with bitcoin wallets that had received over 9.4 million bitcoins.â€FinCEN prosecuted the platform when BTC-e failed to establish policies to handle transactions that were anonymized and conducted through their platform. At the conclusion of the investigation, a $12 million civil money penalty was held against one of BTC-eâ€™s â€œadministrators,â€ Alexander Vinnik, which is currently the â€œlargest individual liability penalty FinCEN has assessed to date.â€The company lacked even basic controls to prevent the use of its services for illicit purposes. As a result, they attracted and maintained a customer base that included many criminals who desired to conceal proceeds from crimes such as ransomware, fraud, identity theft, public corruption, and drug traffickingWhat comes next?FinCEN recently made efforts to better understand emerging technology, and in doing so, has worked to identify risks, close gaps, and support â€œresponsible innovation through clarity.â€For example, FinCEN has established â€œFinCEN Exchange,â€ to work hand-in-hand with the private sector and law enforcement in order to allow financial institutions to engage with FinCEN and law enforcement agencies to share â€œindustry developments, concerns, and risks and threats.â€Despite their proactive stance towards working with businesses, they are first and foremost a regulatory body that has specific guidelines for working as a MSB.Still overwhelmed? Thereâ€™s a solution!To address the mounting scrutiny crypto companies have received from regulators like FinCEN, many have begun implementing traditional, bank level Know-Your-Customer (KYC) programs, often at the dismay of their users. It is trade-off many are reluctant to make, but one that is necessary to function in a compliant ecosystem.The challenge is most organizations do not want to become experts at fraud monitoring or compliance management. The cost and complexity of implementing such programs can be overwhelming when itâ€™s not an intended area of expertise.If you find your organization in a situation where you need to move forward registering as a money services business, but donâ€™t know where to begin on the fraud and compliance needs â€” the good news is thereâ€™s help!Here at Coral, weâ€™ve created a protocol for assigning risk scores to wallet addresses â€” we call the â€œtrust scores.â€ Weâ€™re able to quickly determine if youâ€™re about to send funds to an untrustworthy individual or possible scammer.If youâ€™re looking to make your platform more robust and compliant, Coral Protocol is a great addition to your platform.Make sure to reach out if you have any questions, and check out our upcoming paper on compliance, the SEC, and FinCEN!Sources For This Article:www.fincen.gov*Record keeping regulations: Parts 1010 and 1022 of 31 CFR Chapter X.), 31 CFR Â§ 1010.410, 31 CFR Â§ 1022.310, 31 CFR Â§ 1022.320, 31 CFR Â§ 1010.410(f), 31 CFR Â§ 1010.410(e)----CoralCommunity organizer, connector, VP Marketing @ Coral!

Facebook-owned WhatsApp is developing an integrated cryptocurrency. Facebook is having trouble policing its platform and user data off-platform. Facebook has been facing increased regulatory pressure. These events can coalesce into a strategy that strengthens Facebookâ€™s user data permissions and advertising revenue model while reducing regulatory risk.Facebookâ€™s business model leverages massive swaths of user data to sell online ads. This large-scale data collection is possible through their huge network effects. In 2018, Facebook reported that the average revenue per user (ARPU) in North America alone was around $27.11 per quarter (~$9/month) across 242 million users. Unsurprisingly, the ARPU is dominated by advertising sales.Often asked about a subscription, that would require offsetting the revenue per user in order to be economically viable. A recent survey found that only about ~30% of users would be willing to pay the monthly amount required to remove ads and the gap between what people say in a survey vs actually taking out their wallets is often quite large.The formula is simple yet terrifically sophisticated to execute:To maximize engagement, they built a slot machine for the human brain. The longer you are in the walled garden and the more activity you produce, the better you can be targeted. Facebook has a history of farming data, releasing products as auto opt-in, trading away userâ€™s data (not selling) and apologizing. For a detailed history check out the article by WIRED.Large companies such as Facebook are well-heeled to comply with GDPR while having little impact on their user engagement and therefore data collection activities. This is compounded by the fact that consumers have demonstrated little concern for data privacy breaches, even when they are directly affected.If you want more in-depth information on the business model I highly recommend a great article by Len Sherman.I believe that data is becoming a form of labor and raw materials. A single user in a vacuum doesnâ€™t have much value and advertisers want to be able to target users at scale. Facebook and other platforms are indeed giving access to something of value, and most people donâ€™t actually care about their privacy, or even worse, donâ€™t understand what they are giving up. Users, I would argue, should be allowed to control how and if their data leaves the platform where it was created.As that data is combined and refined across platforms the potency goes up. The metaphor of data as new oil is so powerful for that reason. Not only are technology companies prospecting for new data sources, but they are also looking to apply context and meaning in order to refine that data. Ben Thompson talks about this in detail comparing these companies less as networks and more so as marketplaces.Facebook may never be able to deliver proper data management without completely scrapping the ad-based model that has taken them this far. When changes to an algorithm powered by our data have an effect on millions of companies and billions of users that could help or harm, the question begins to surface on how you should best wield immense power.Facebook didnâ€™t sell our data, it gave it away in exchange for data it didnâ€™t have. This has allowed Facebook to become the de-facto data broker for the internet and get closer to a complete digital profile of all its users. As I have been writing this, it is serendipitous that the New York Times released a not surprising article on Facebookâ€™s continued data management woes. It is an excellent read if you want a high-level overview but it should also not be surprising as these partnerships are not new. They have been announced publicly and on stage by countless CEOs including that of Netflix, Spotify, and Apple as far back as 2011.At the time no one cared or raised any concerns. Investors were just happy that Facebook was experiencing explosive growth. If Facebook had been directly selling our data, everyone would have been outraged and it would have been seen as repugnant that they would profit off of us outside of their platform. Instead of a direct transaction, they were indirectly doing the same thing by selling higher value ads.But how closely was Facebook monitoring its data partners?Considering how much difficulty Facebook has had at managing its own data, this is compounded on the belief that all the partners are able to manage it as well, in other countries. If your data ended up on Yandexâ€™s servers, how did we plan on stopping that data from ending up in the Kremlinâ€™s office? If you believe that one company lending data is the only one at fault then we have other issues to discuss.To make matters worse, no one involved is taking responsibility, claiming to either not be aware of the scope of data made available to them and not using it or, stating they had used the data appropriately while refusing to disclose the details of the partnership.Data is stolen by hackers and resold on the dark web; data is held for ransom by malicious entities, and people pay to retrieve it; data is legally gathered, bought, sold and traded to be used for targeted advertising, political analysis, healthcare (public and private), science and research, and law enforcement organizations.Thatâ€™s not a good outcome for a company trying to lift itself out of a cycle of bad PR. Ultimately, Facebook has only itself to blame. The hunger for data and personal information with a lack of transparency is continuing to draw the ire of regulators. Even last December the D.C. attorney general filed a lawsuit against Facebook for their mismanagement of user data.Companies that it views as a threat would be bought, cloned or cut off from access. This is exactly what happened when Twitter purchased Vine in 2013.â€œUnless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today,â€ Justin Osofsky, a Facebook executive, said in an email at the time.Mr. Zuckerberg responded: â€œYup, go for it.â€Facebook and the rest of silicon valley have monopolies on various facets of our lives. Google and Facebook across their properties touch almost every single internet user on a recurring basis. Being able to stifle competition on a large enough scale risks being seen as running afoul of competition law.Trustbusters attempting to break up the company into smaller segments will destroy what makes Facebook the most valuable. Network effects. There is also a high likelihood that one of the Facebabies will eventually cannibalize their siblings as network effects set in again. Price controls and profit caps will not be effective on a platform that is already free for users and would come at the high price of lost innovation.The economist talks about how user data is the currency through which users pay for those free services. An argument is that regulators could require companies to share this anonymized bulk data with competitors for a fee. This would turn data from something Facebook and others hoard, to suppress competition, into something users share, to foster innovation. My rebuttal, however, goes back to an earlier point. As this data is passed around and refined with context, the value continues increasing. We allowed Facebook to have our data, not necessarily their partners. We will power your ecosystem, not your friends.So what can they do in order to reduce their regulatory risk?The rising threat of regulation, something that most of tech has desperately wanted to avoid for years is the largest concern. Facebook has already publicly stated that they are willing to sacrifice profits in the short term to avoid legal intervention.Data breaches and platform abuse are going to continue popping up. WhatsApp is recently the newest property accused of abuse regarding child pornography and fake news causing violence.Facebook will ultimately be responsible for how users interact on their properties and need to police itself. Their platform is allowing pockets of users to find commonalities with others and share those beliefs at record speeds. For better and worse.Blockchain is something 99% of the world will not care about. Just like the internet is a series of tubes connecting things, Blockchain will be an abstract concept that makes things work.Zuckerberg is not inherently malicious. I believe he truly wants to connect the world and to allow new communities to flourish that were never before possible. This comes from the parallel seen with Bill Gates â€” brilliant, driven, and fighting to make a global empire at all costs. After leaving Microsoft, he viewed philanthropy as a responsibility for those with wealth. After you have taken care of yourself and your family, society is next.Recent hires and acquisitions in the blockchain space moving towards an internal currency are most likely a continued push towards deeper data aggregation considering the value of userâ€™s financial data. According to a bunch of different sources, full personal data is worth somewhere between $250-$3000 per year.Let us go back to the concept of a data broker. What if Facebook were to offer portability and interoperability of our data? Facebook and Google already allow you to download all of your data and GDPR allows you to request that data be deleted. The problem is, once I take my data with me, I cannot do much with it.What if, we allow Facebook to continue to track userâ€™s data while using their free services but, give the user rights to control access to that data from third parties. This is the fundamental shift. I propose that Facebook could and should create an open protocol for exchanging user data. They already have the users, scale, money, and influence to make this happen versus a startup with no users or adoption trying to battle the titans and government.The user, in turn, can share that additional data with another service or not, but new data created on other platforms would be tracked and maintained by that native platform as well. So my shopping habits are stored and used by Amazon but, I get the access keys that control sharing. This concept can already be handled using public/private key pairs, sans blockchain. I would anchor my public key with the various parties that are on the protocol that I engage with and could verify with my private key as needed. The issue for most users is, it needs to be as simple as modern 2FA (two-factor authentication) apps like Authy. The UI has to be great, not just functional. I should be able to scan in say, a QR code for my public key and sign data requests with my private key by scanning a QR code or entering a one-time passcode (TOTA for 2FA).This would commoditize the value of user data which is currently proprietary. Market forces would price this out at scale. As a user was traveling the world wide web, there would need to be a way to allow a third party to see that I have a blob of Facebook data. While it is stored on Facebookâ€™s database and is fully encrypted, there would be an identifier and cryptographic signature to prove authenticity that identifies that blob of data as coming from Facebook. There is an inherent value/trust to their brand.The value could be tied to the time of data creation + quantity + category of data shared, similar to websites asking permission to cookie users. There could be a pop-up request for your data with a pricing value attached to it that could be deposited to your wallet upon completion.Who says it has to be cash value and not something else? Maybe a free Prime membership or discounted other goods? According to CIRP, Prime members spend an average of $1300 vs $700 for non-members. Still sounds like a sweet deal for Amazon. Amazon already knows your purchasing history but could further personalize that data with your social graph. So if Facebook has the data, can they provide additional value to existing networks in the form of personal connections? Can I ride with an Uber driver I know in my network personally? Can I watch a show on Netflix at the same time as my friends to chat during it? When I am looking to make a purchase, can I try to get my friendsâ€™ opinions?After a request, there would be a series of validations that would be made to the other platformâ€™s data. The issuer of that data would verify the request by requiring authorization from the user. Identity management projects Sovrin and Microsoft, among others, are already working on these types of solutions using blockchain from the lens purely of identity.Wired discusses why this is so valuable in the future:The basic premise: Personal data could be verified once by a third-party, like the government agency, and then retained securely by an individual. Rather than sending your Social Security number to a company or service, for example, the Social Security Administration could put an unalterable stamp of approval on the blockchain that can be verified on request. A user could provide proof that theyâ€™re a real person without ever revealing the Social Security number itself.This would be analogous to using blockchain as a public notary service. Some data from other platforms would be more valuable than others depending on your business needs. There could be a mechanism to show categorical data types available (social [facebook], search [google], purchasing [amazon], consumption [netflix]) then, that company can buy the relevant data and pay for it accordingly. This would allow granularity of control for the user with a value attached to it.This would provide additional value to Facebook for the pools of user data that they already have. Since Facebook is providing such a great service and willing to clean this data for itself and reuse, there could be a revenue sharing agreement. Any compensation received for a userâ€™s Facebook data could include a kicker that is passed back to Facebook for maintaining and securing that data. Facebook is already sharing our data in return for more data, the paradigm shift is effecting control of that transfer.Knowing that users are lazy and already do not consider app permissions, there would need to be strict controls on explaining why that data is needed and how it will be used. Currently, app store installs do this in a marginal way. It would also need to have time limits on the data as well. Meaning, the access can be revoked (although it could be copied) and verifiably destroyed (similar to GDPR requests). Data retains some long tail value but also has a decay curve over time depending on the specific type. Data about buying toilet paper 10 years ago is not as valuable as if I did in the past 30 days (retargeting).This would also recuse the service of how others are using the data. If I, the individual, share the data to someone who manages it irresponsibly, then they would be reprimanded by the network. There could be a system of checks by the users on the network and the ability for me to request that data be removed. While imperfect, it allows the responsibility to fall into the hands of the individual user.Storing data at scale on the blockchain is impractical at the moment. IPFS and other storage initiatives have a few points against them:To get around this, the data will be stored on the companyâ€™s servers as it is now. Following GDPR policy, it would be illegal if a company is ever caught not fulfilling the request of a user to have their data removed. The disincentive to cheat is watching a percentage of your global revenue get fined away by regulators. That combined with the ability for users to pack up and leave the platform creates a strong incentive for the platforms to act in a way to build trust with their users.While we mostly trust large companies like Facebook and Amazon to transact honestly, we might not trust arbitrary actors on the internet to do the same. For these cases, an escrow service could enter, along with our use-case for smart contracts on a blockchain.In this scenario, a party commits something of value to a contract in exchange for a userâ€™s data. The request to the data store is initiated and the access is granted, conditional to the payment being released. The contract could handle the revenue split to the data issuer and the user.There is an immediate issue of metadata leaking. As I sell my data, those transactions will be logged on the public ledger. So even if the Facebook data is encrypted with a simple <ID: Facebook> tag, someone monitoring the public ledger would be able to see a history of what company data was sold by individuals. Over time this can be used to build a profile of the user.In order to accomplish this, there would need to be a form of secure multi-party computation combined with a sort of private value transfer (ZCash, Monero, Aztec, or Enigma). Essentially secure/private smart contract computations for data escrow. Some of the pieces for this technology exist and some do not. Encrypted user data, funds from the third party and the userâ€™s consent in the form of a cryptographic signature would be required as inputs for these transactions. Once each of the inputs has been given the escrow releases, this would cause the user to receive their funds and the requester to receive a decrypted copy of the userâ€™s data. Someone more technologically minded is hopefully putting these things together!At the end of the day the data providers like Facebook can still do whatever theyâ€™d like with your data because they own it. This system, however, provides a means for them to be explicit about data sales and relinquish control to users as a way to protect their reputation.Imagine the social currency that would come with Facebook taking a real stand on user privacy and data while still allowing their business to thrive? Even though users in masse donâ€™t seem to care about these issues, it would do a world of good for regulators to see self-enforcement. Users gain trust in knowing that they can punish a platform by revoking access to data. By taking the first stab at an open protocol, it would generate massive long-term value for shareholders. Losing a fight with regulators is uncomfortable but survivable. Microsoft did it. Taking the lead allows you to get in front of the issues.From the economist:While it would hit your share price, it could offer long-term advantages. The way in which it opens you up to competition reinforces your centrality to the ecosystem â€” and that ecosystem may, as a result, grow faster. The interoperability forced on Microsoft at the turn of the century, which allowed rivals to make their products more compatible with Windows, had that sort of accelerating effect â€” and Microsoft has hardly gone away. It is worth more than three times as much now as it was then.There is also the issue with monitoring data on their own platform. Going back to identity on platform, we donâ€™t want to police users or impact free speech. Bots, however, are a different case.Facebookâ€™s biggest internal threat is confirmation bias. Creating search bubbles and echo chambers around the things on which we most agree. While this isnâ€™t inherently bad, we are bombarded with so much data and news it has become impossible to determine what is grounded in fact anymore. Especially when many of these individual accounts very well could be bots. If you are to view Facebook as a media platform then it might do them justice to blend similar stories together from various news sources. As they already aggregate swaths of data, they could create an incentive (paid in Facebook stars of course) to bring dissenting views together in order to gamify fact-checking each other. Use a system of oracle providers such as Snopes, PolitiFact, and Facecheck as external validators for news stories that are being shared. While there is still the difficulty of allowing differing opinions, at least what is being touted as facts can be checked.From the Conversation regarding Twitter and showcasing these issues:These bots are able to construct filter bubbles around vulnerable users, feeding them false claims and misinformation. First, they can attract the attention of human users who support a particular candidate by tweeting that candidateâ€™s hashtags or by mentioning and retweeting the person. Then the bots can amplify false claims smearing opponents by retweeting articles from low-credibility sources that match certain keywords. This activity also makes the algorithm highlight for other users false stories that are being shared widely.Since this data sharing protocol can become an identity layer of sorts, Facebook can monitor the interactions these users have across networks. This would make identifying bots much easier.Users that do not have a data repository spread across ecosystems, even if they are not willing to sell data, have a higher potential be a bot. If these users have a pattern of sharing certain news types from lower quality media outlets it would help further police its own platform increasing the trustability. This would allow fines to be imposed on a company for bad acting and could have identifiers tied to the individual userâ€™s data. In the case of regulatory action, the fine levied could be passed directly to users impacted. Users would show their trust by using or not using a platform and trust can be a long tail attribute to the platform.With this protocol you can begin to build out new products that focus on different user experiences which have always been the core of your offerings. Optimizing for user collisions. Instead of simply aggregating for the sole purpose of data collection, there can be another goal of maximizing engagement and the user experience instead. Possibly beginning to offer differentiated and more meaningful sub-communities. Building a stronger personal relationship instead of optimizing for content that will simply have the most reactions, often times forcing a more polarizing viewpoint amongst users all while continuing to collect data and build trust across the industry.What if this could be abstracted away in order to create a platform where you can buy the opportunity to talk to people? Political candidates could buy time with people that align to them OR could buy time to refute things that are being said to them. A transparency initiative for Facebook led by Facebook. Focus groups, political motives, matching to go see a movie together similar to matching for video games and a bunch of new collective experiences where the user has a modicum of control.This idea could even lead to a dashboard by a service provider built on top of the protocol, showing a personalized list of available jobs: from watching advertising (the computerâ€™s camera collects facial reactions), to translating a text into a rare language, to exploring a virtual building to see how easy it is to navigate. The dashboard might also list past earnings, show ratings and suggest new skills. All of these become new potential revenue streams for Facebook.The last point is making sure users are getting a fair price. We are often lazy and donâ€™t have the inclination to keep track of all our data, privacy or have the proper bargaining power. I believe with a public protocol as I have described, this could open the door for digital data unions for those who do not want to manage things on an individual basis. These organizations serve as gatekeepers of peopleâ€™s data. For a fee of course.From the economist:Like their predecessors, Unions will negotiate rates, monitor membersâ€™ data work and ensure the quality of their digital output, for instance by keeping reputation scores. Unions could funnel specialist data work to their members and even organize strikes, for instance by blocking access to exert influence on a company employing its membersâ€™ data. Similarly, data unions could be conduits channeling membersâ€™ data contributions, all while tracking them and billing firms that benefit from them.I think it was important to take a holistic view of Facebook and their operations and think about what they could do. I think there is a lot of merit to them trying to recover from the bad press that has been plaguing them for the past year. This model could be applied to any company that has achieved scale and network effects with a close relationship to the end user. It is almost an inevitability that these companies are going to collide and/or become regulated. Competition destroys profits and regulation can be painful if you donâ€™t get in front of it.I donâ€™t think Zuckerberg is malicious but his actions could be considered reckless. Facebook has so much power and control over our day to day lives and it becomes easy to lose sight of the forest through the trees.***Nothing in this article should be taken as legal or investment advice.----1Alpine IntelOperations Lead @Alpine.

I canâ€™t say that I would do things in another way if I had a chance. For sure, I have never regretted a decision to join a business-related program at my university.I started to code at the end of the first year of my bachelors degree. In the beginning, it was just a fun hobby I used to enjoy doing in my spare time. It all boiled down to watching tutorials on different online platforms and coding along.After a couple of years, it became evident that solving problems, creating things from scratch and constantly learning something new was something that drove me to an inexpressible extent. I stopped thinking about further pursuing a career in marketing. Instead, I focused on spending all of my free time exploring the fundamentals of programming, trending technologies and best practices of writing code.Back then I didnâ€™t want to abandon my studies. I saw a real added value of being a programmer with a marketing + business background. Thus, I decided to get a Master of Science degree in marketing abroad. At the same time, it was a chance to try to find myself a job in a new environment and open a lot of exciting perspectives for personal development.I chose Vienna as one of the most gorgeous cities in Europe. It has amazing public transport, a great healthcare system and has been for many years on the list of top global positions among the most comfortable cities to live in the world.Before the actual takeaways part starts, here is the main thing you need to know about learning to code as a career-changer or hobbyist:Whatever your background is, you CAN learn to code if it is what drives you and brings joy to your life.I know so many people who worked in or studied finance, marketing, history and changed their careers to become programmers and were extremely successful.Letâ€™s see what exact approaches you can use to achieve that desired result faster and get your job as a developer.This core principle canâ€™t be missed if you want to get better at something. Of course, watching a video or reading a tutorial on Medium seems like a very good investment.However, you may learn much more effectively by following this simple strategy:Think of some project that you would love to use. It may be very simple in the beginning and have basic functionality. For example, I wrote my first small app in just a couple of files and it was just plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript - no frameworks, no libraries.If you just come up with ideas of what should be present on your site and learn to formulate them clearly you will find an answer for almost any problem on Stack Overflow or other similar resources.It will allow you to learn those things proactively and put efforts into the actual development of your core dev skill - problem solving.At the very beginning, I spent too much time learning fundamentals and basics. For sure, they are extremely important to know. However, if you are not interested in more advanced topics and donâ€™t read about them from time to time you wonâ€™t be able to kick start your learning abilities.I had been doing web basics for already a year or two and only heard that such cool things as React, Vue.js, Webpack, etc. existed. I never decided to try them out at first. I had to overcome a fear that I wouldnâ€™t understand anything.But then, I started to gradually increase the complexity of things I wanted to learn. You would be very surprised how fast you will pick up new technologies and be ready to use them after you force yourself out of the comfort zone.Tip: Often attempt to play with the more complex toys.Many people think that now is the best time to learn web-development because of the plethora of technologies and tools available as open source.Moreover, many of them have very strong communities that can support you during the learning process. For example, they can get you out of frustrating situations when you just canâ€™t make things work properly.It comes with a price though. Itâ€™s easy to get caught into the trap of just jumping from one technology to another and not really learning anything in depth.The better approach would be researching the field and trying to make your own opinion of things. Always look for the advice of professionals, but decide for yourself what makes you happy to work with.After all, many things are solving the same problems but in slightly different ways. As a beginner developer, you probably wouldnâ€™t need to learn React, Vue.js, and Angular at the same time.Tip: Try to focus on one thing and become an expert in itHowever, be open to learning new technologies and tools. In my opinion, it is one of the most important prerequisites of getting a well-paid and interesting job.I must say that soft skills are quite underrated for developers though they can help you a lot to improve in many aspects.Initially, I used to think that those interesting people on Twitter were some sort of celebrities. They donâ€™t answer any messages and spend all of their time building cool things. In reality, itâ€™s not even close to the truth.Since Iâ€™ve destroyed this bias in my head I reached out to lots of them and learned a lot in both professional and personal areas of my life.Do me a favor. Find a person you would like to have a short conversation with who interests you as a developer and person. Be polite, respect their time and have some clear questions in mind. Write to them and you would be surprised how much you learn!In the worst case, they would just say that itâ€™s not their top priority now but you could try again in some time.If you would be interested in getting some personalized advice from me regarding any topic, I would be really be happy to help. I try to answer every private message within a couple of days and give advice based on what people are asking for.To be completely honest with you, at first, I was quite skeptical about my prospects. After having read lots of articles and forums I got an idea that it was almost impossible for a foreigner to get a job in Austria (this may be different from country to country, but Austria, apart from being an amazing country in many ways, is very bureaucratic).In reality, things turned out to be not that complicated and all I needed to do was to start applying and see how things worked myself.The main takeaway:Donâ€™t overthink it! If you define your goals and start with small steps, youâ€™ll eventually get there!So, to get started with your job search, define the roles that you want to apply for. It will help you to learn about the required technology stack. Consequently, you will soon identify some weak spots you need to improve.Depending on the situation you might also want to improve your CV, see how many jobs there are, or complete your LinkedIn profile.A good starting point on your way to finding a developer job abroad might be websites like https://relocate.me.Many beginner developers fall into the bias of thinking that they are not ready to apply after some time of learning and coding just within the scope of pet-projects. Itâ€™s not always true. Often, passion means more than experience or real job experience in the case of junior positions.Apply from the early stages of your learning processes, but be ready to show some dedication to your employerIn my case, it was a different story because Iâ€™ve already had work experience and many projects on GitHub that I was ready to talk about. My best advice here is that you need to show consistency and passion for coding and that is just doing things and showcasing them on your GitHub profile from the earliest stages of your developer career.My current German level is Upper Intermediate but Iâ€™m still ashamed of the fact that I canâ€™t properly have long meaningful conversations. ðŸ˜†Most of the jobs in Austria require proficiency in German so Iâ€™ve missed out on a lot of opportunities just because of not applying to those jobs. Moreover, 99% of jobs were listed as full-time positions. As a student, I am able to work for only 20 hours per week, so that excluded the rest of them.I decided to take it seriously and write a cover letter for every position Iâ€™ve been applying to. Just to fill you in on my specific situation, I had no German proficiency, no work permit, and no ability to work full-time.I was startled by the response I received. Out of almost 20 applications, I got an invitation for an onsite interview for 15 and responses are still coming in.My current employer was quite optimistic about my prospects in the company and offered me a part-time position with the plan to transfer it to full time as soon as I finish my studies. Also, he helps me a lot with everything connected with work permits and other legal stuff.Donâ€™t think that job requirements are final. In most cases they are flexible and you can get a job even without some required things in your CVThatâ€™s it for this blog post. Iâ€™ve tried to provide some condensed advice that I wish I had before starting an application for jobs abroad. I will be happy to receive any feedback in the comments and hope that this post is helpful to you in your job search.In case you want any specific advice, feel free to drop me a message on Twitter.I can have a look at your CV, portfolio or tech stack and formulate your strengths and things you need to improve or just have a chat at your convenience - DMs are open ðŸ™ŒðŸ¼Originally published at divdev.io----3Weâ€™ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/newsJS developerðŸ’»| WriterðŸ“|TutorðŸ‘¨ðŸ»â€ðŸ’»| Reactâš›ï¸| FirebaseðŸ”¥| Gatsby.jsðŸ¸| Github: https://github.com/d-ivashchuk Blog: http://divdev.ioDimitri Ivashchuk--1TKinWeâ€™ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news--132Preethi KasireddyinWeâ€™ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news--111Dimitri Ivashchuk--Alex Mathers--220The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Scott H.

Experts in the field of transportation know that daily travel choices often boil down to a few basic variables: cost, travel time, waiting and walking times, reliability, and other transportation system service levels. Over the past several years, mobile phones have had an enormous impact on how we move in cities â€” not only spawning the growth of ride-hailing services (such as Lyft and Uber) â€” but also fundamentally influencing the way that individuals obtain information about and pay for their mobility alternatives.Last week, I had the opportunity to speak at the 2016 National Shared Mobility Summit in Chicago, where several hundred leaders from public transit agencies, private shared mobility providers, and automotive companies gathered to discuss the latest developments in carsharing, bikesharing, ride-hailing, and transportation-as-a-service. It is clear that a major transformation is underway; however, there is still much more change to come.One of the key challenges that we face is harnessing this dramatic change for the public good. Thanks in large part to the disruption by private shared mobility services, the public transit sector is experiencing a renaissance. It is a critical time for us to build partnerships that can ensure future transportation innovations improve access to mobility for all citizens â€” ones that are affordable, safe, and energy efficient. Here, I offer a few takeaways from the National Shared Mobility Summit and ideas on how we can forge a path to connect public transit and shared mobility for the greater good. 1. Public transit is the original shared mobility service During her opening speech on the second day of the conference, Rebekah Scheinfeld, the Commissioner of the Chicago Department of Transportation reminded us that â€œpublic transit is the core; shared mobility is built on that core.â€ There is significant overlap in the users of new, private shared mobility companies and public transit in large part because shared mobility can most efficiently be provided in large, metropolitan areas with high levels of population density which are already well served by public transit.A recent study by DePaulâ€™s Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development compared UberPOOL trips and Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) trips. They found that for neighborhood to downtown trips, while UberPOOL was on average six minutes faster than the CTA, it provided that service at five times the price â€” an option that the vast majority of urban travelers would not choose. While private shared mobility companies might provide more efficient service for certain routes and markets underserved by public transit, trunk line rail and bus service can and should remain the core in most urban areas. 2. Public transit and shared mobility can be complementary Shared mobility services like Uber and Lyft arenâ€™t likely to fade away anytime soon, and they continue to evolve rapidly. While we know relatively little about how they influence travel behavior, early research on the topic suggests that shared mobility services have the potential to be complementary to public transit.In a report released by the Shared Use Mobility Center (SUMC) and American Public Transportation Association (APTA), a survey found that people who use shared modes of transportation are more likely to use public transit. Furthermore, they found that lifestyle changes may occur when people use private shared mobility options. According to their survey, 15% of respondents reported using public transit more after they started using carsharing, bikesharing or ride-hailing services.There are additional benefits when urban travelers use multiple shared services. Those who routinely use several shared options (bikesharing, carsharing, and ride-hailing) â€” coined â€œsupersharersâ€ by the APTA report, own half as many cars as people who use transit alone. In another recent study, the carsharing service car2go was found to remove as many as 11 cars from city streets. While more data and research are needed on ride-hailing (versus carsharing) services, it seems clear that there is the potential for shared services to complement public transit and enable a car-free lifestyle.3. There is a much-needed groundswell of innovation to improve public transit services In the past year, public transit agencies have begun to experience a groundswell of innovation to meet the needs of growing cities. Last fall, LA Metro created the Office of Extraordinary Innovation, led by CIO Joshua Schank. Tasked with informing the high-level vision and long-term strategy for the agency, they are welcoming new ideas and pilot projects to improve mobility throughout the Los Angeles region. A recipient of the recently awarded Federal Transit Administration Mobility on Demand (FTA MOD) grants, LA Metro is among several transit agencies that is championing much-needed change in the public sector.As new private sector solutions have rapidly entered the transportation scene, public transit agencies are beginning to cultivate their own experiments to dramatically improve mobility services in their cities. While many of these pilots are just getting off the ground, the level of interest in shaping public transit services has never been higher than now. 4. Developing public-private partnerships between transit agencies and the private sector is key The recently awarded FTA Mobility on Demand grants also promotes collaboration between public transit agencies and the private sector to develop solutions that can connect transit service and shared mobility providers. A great example of a successful public-private sector partnership is that of another FTA Mobility on Demand award winner, the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District (TriMet), and moovel North America.In September 2013, TriMet became the first public transit agency to implement a mobile payment solution for multiple transit services using the moovel transit platform. This year, moovel partnered with them to launch RideTap, a feature integrated into the TriMet Tickets application that connects public transit riders with shared mobility services, including car2go, Lyft, Zipcar, and BIKETOWN, Portlandâ€™s new bikesharing system. moovelâ€™s public transit solutions deliver real-time information and ease of payment to transit users, while also addressing the first/last mile challenge of getting riders from the station to their front door.A clear takeaway from the National Shared Mobility Summit is that partnerships between cities, transit agencies, and the private sector are critical to usher in the next wave of transportation innovation. Although we are in the early stages of developing integrated, multimodal transportation solutions, the future is bright. Through increased collaboration between public and private transportation providers, I believe we can deliver cheaper, faster, and more energy efficient mobility solutions for cities â€” and the big winner will be the daily traveler.â€” Please note that this article expresses the opinions of the author and does not reflect the views of Move Forward.----Move Forward BlogDiscussing the future of urban mobility and smart cities.Move ForwardinMove Forward Blog--Move ForwardinMove Forward Blog--Move ForwardinMove Forward Blog--Move ForwardinMove Forward Blog--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Alex Mathers--220HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

We now have an endless supply of blank pages on a screen, with which we can write and delete without â€˜wastingâ€™ space. Itâ€™s â€˜more convenient to carry around a laptop or tablet than several notebooks and pencil cases, praying we donâ€™t run out of physical space. But what about the physicalness of writing on paper with a pen? What about the way you lean closer and closer to the page the more tired you are, and eventually fall asleep on the paper? The physical aspect of writing, not typing, is that we understand more what we write. Each letter, word, sentence, means so much more to us than a â€˜tip-tapâ€™ of our keyboards.Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love being able to share my stories and writing with friends back home. Typing makes this so much easier and having access to the internet makes it easier to write accurately.

People would talk about good books and there wasnâ€™t as much of a platform for people to access all the information about a book. It makes reading easier, yes, but there is something to be said for reading a book you donâ€™t like, even partially through, because then you must ask yourself, â€œWell, why didnâ€™t I like the book?â€ Then when you know what it is about that book, you can steer yourself clear of the books which are described the same way. Or you might end up in the weird, â€œI didnâ€™t like the story, but I liked the moral of the storyâ€ and realize that you shouldnâ€™t judge a book by its cover or what people have said about it.

WilliamsFollow--ListenShareVanessa Mason is the research director for Institute for The Futureâ€™s (IFTF) Future 50 Partnership, a network of future-smart organizations that support strategic foresight and research into the urgent futures that will shape the next decade across business, social and civic spheres.She will deliver a keynote presentation at the HXD Conference on April 2â€“3. Vanessa will share how equity and inclusive design are competitive advantages for stakeholders advancing health innovation by providing highlights from research on the future of health and power.I interviewed Vanessa to better understand her work and impact in designing inclusive futures.Iâ€™ve always worked in health and healthcare. Iâ€™m new to futures research but there are many parallels between working in tech and futures, two approaches to addressing large complex challenges.Iâ€™m someone who brings a lot of left and right brain to this work. With my left brain, I drill down into the data and analyze the details. In tech, this could be analyzing user data or conducting a literature review to inform product development. In my role at IFTF, Iâ€™m looking for innovations and research findings that are emerging across various sectors and asking whether there is something viable and plausible emerging from that data, integrating large-scale factors like population health or climate change.And then I get to use my right brain and apply design thinking strategies and be creative. Technology plays a huge role in health innovation, but we often forget about the human impact and reactions to new technologies. So I will work through potential scenarios of what might happen should we remove what is known or constant. At those moments or intersections of divergence in the data, I can begin to think about what might be possible and the consequences of disruptions.There is a myth of equitability and meritocracy in Silicon Valley. I still very much bring my perspective of inspiring inclusion into the work I do now. We need to have diverse voices as part of the design of the future â€” because how do you design any future without inclusivity?So Iâ€™m sharing IFTFâ€™s research at various local, diverse events, acknowledging that itâ€™s through diversity where creativity thrives.I see myself as holding the mirror up to our present. Tech offers two major value propositions: scale and acceleration. Thereâ€™s an opportunity to reach more people, learn faster, and adapt more rapidly. But then there is a reluctance to confront some personal beliefs that support the myth of meritocracy because those conversations can be uncomfortable. But they donâ€™t have to be. One reason I love futures is thereâ€™s a comfort that can come in talking about it. No one knows the future. All of us belong there and all of us can take part in building the future if we are willing to both imagine and take action today.Itâ€™s ok to not know where youâ€™re going but itâ€™s important to start somewhere and continue to learn what youâ€™re doing, and move incrementally.Each year thereâ€™s a different lens for Future 50â€™s research. Last year was trust. This year is power.What this means is that weâ€™re thinking about the concept of power and its ability to affect really big consequences. Weâ€™ve seen traditional displays of power such as strikes and protests in the last couple of years but weâ€™ve also seen new modes like collaborations driven by the emergence of new incentives or new technologies. The lens of power helps us examine whoâ€™s in the room, consider how they are collaborating, and question whoâ€™s setting the agenda and the benefits they receive.Having worked in health care for some time now, I see a lot of us operating in collaborations without mutually understood shared language and agendas. Weâ€™re seeing a lot of unconventional partnerships, especially as it relates to social determinants of health.But itâ€™s easy to say â€œcollaborationâ€ or â€œinnovationâ€ and not really make an impact. The technology or innovation becomes the focus rather than the behaviors, processes, and systems that need to shift to accommodate what the innovation is meant to enable. The real power that collaboration brings is in having people come together to facilitate hard conversations around what our beliefs are and understanding what the less effective ways of working are that the partners are willing to give up. Itâ€™s also important to be able to ask for forgiveness when things go wrong and be willing to keep working toward continuous improvement. These sort of conversations arenâ€™t happening enough or at a deep enough level to set an agenda that shifts outcomes.Collaboration is really hard. At a basic level, collaboration is about value sharing and acting on that.Only when thereâ€™s a deep recognition, respect, and sense of accountability for each otherâ€™s values can we give innovation a fair shot.Now, Iâ€™m looking at how organizations of the future are going to be structured and operate. Weâ€™re seeing a lot of volatility in the market place â€” the work itself, our co-workers, metrics and approaches to measuring success, and so much more are moving. Weâ€™re also seeing a shift in relationships between people and their organizations. People are being treated and held accountable within organizations differently.Thinking about the future is scary for most people. What we provide is a set of tools to help prepare organizations to build the mindset and capacity for change through strategic foresight. One way we do this is through an exercise where we look back to see examples of past changes or disruptions so they can remember how they have coped with change in the past. This makes the inevitability of change more tangible. Theyâ€™ve experienced it already, and they can experience it again. Only this time, perhaps with more intention and preparedness.With our research, we develop a range of forecasts and scenarios to help our partners see who is benefitting and who isnâ€™t under a variety of circumstances. No one can predict the future but we can anticipate possibilities so we can shift people away from equating change with loss and show opportunities as well.Once we can get people to see this, they open their minds and start thinking about all the possibilities for actions to take to make the world a better place for people to live in.----Anthropologist working in technology and health. @columbia @nyuniversitySusan E.

It is said to be a product because this currency is manifested in the form of coins or digital tokens that are widely traded through the internet network. This trade in coins or digital tokens was first initiated by the Bitcoin platform. However, this platform then applies a mining system to get coins in new or original conditions. Along with the passage of time, the development of cryptocurrency began to be felt increasingly widespread and began to try their luck to dominate the trading market. This effort can be seen from the existence of a number of parties who imposed a payment system on offline purchases using digital currencies.Not only that, the market for trading of digital coins and tokens continues to increase in number each year followed by an increase in the number of buyers and users. This is driven by an interesting fact that cryptocurrency does not have a special party responsible for it. At first glance this might seem to be a hindrance because the absence of responsible parties makes it doubtful by some parties about who actually manages the digital financial system. What is meant here is that the transaction system using digital currencies is not controlled by a centralized or centralized system, but is run by blockchain technology which makes the system decentralized.A decentralized system makes every component contained in it not only able to be controlled by one party, but requires a number of other parties that are interconnected and work together in terms of securing the network. This role is carried out by nodes involved in the blockchain technology network as network managers so that they are always available at all times to carry out transactions. Blockchain technology has its own ability to manage network security by relying on encryption systems related to cryptography. This makes this technology superior in terms of security systems compared to security systems commonly used by other financial institutions. Therefore, it is not surprising that this technology is the choice of many cryptocurrency-producing digital platforms.The development continues to be able to be integrated with various functions. If at first, the blockchain makes cryptocurrency only be used to simply run buying and selling transactions or exchanged with other types of digital currency, now cryptocurrency can already perform other functions such as serving land buying, product spending, social media, content creation, health services, and as a reward in the game. For the last function, its use has been very frequent and spread very widely. There are so many types of game applications that guarantee prizes in the form of coins or digital tokens. In general, this type of game is played online and connected with other internet users from various countries.The obstacle experienced by game players is that they are often deceived and do not get a number of coins or promised tokens after winning the game. This is experienced by some people who often fail to obtain digital assets in the games they play. Losses are caused mainly for players who have to make payment transactions to be able to enter the game arena. No party is responsible for this. this is the disadvantage of the digital world where no party directly has a relationship in terms of the economy that are face to face. Digital systems remain digital systems that only run through an internet connection and do not bring together interacting parties.To restore a conducive playing atmosphere, a platform called Dabanking provides services specifically intended to provide entertainment content in the form of game applications. This platform will guarantee that every game played by users has the appropriate rewards for the winners. These rewards can be achieved directly by those who win without worrying about the vagueness of the gift giving system. By supporting a protection system from blockchain technology, Dabanking was built to gather user trust by supporting the concept of system transparency. Every procedure that must be passed will be applied fairly to all people who want to enjoy the playing experience with guaranteed unquestioned benefits.Dabanking relies on the development of Dapps or decentralized applications which are currently the most developed types of applications by technology experts. This application can be accessed through the Dabanking platform so that each game application can be run by participating in operating blockchain technology at the same time. This makes every game lover more comfortable to enjoy the game with guaranteed DAB token prizes officially.Thank you for reading my article for more information please click the link below:Website: https://dabanking.io/homeTwitter: https://twitter.com/Dabanking_ioWhite paper: https://fomo.dabanking.io/static/whitepaper.pdfâ€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€”My Bitcointalk ID: ImanmudaMy Bitcointalk URL: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2538358;sa=summaryMy ETH: 0x592C3c1E55cea51529221F5f32b287c31a8a0bCB#Dapps #DABANKING #FomoJackpot #Blockchain #ETH----Iman muda--Iman muda--Iman muda--Iman muda--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Because it is done illegally, this action is also automatically carried out anonymously. This is done by creating fake accounts that also contain false data. This method is deliberately done so that users can not report their crime formally. The description of the level of technological sophistication that we see today, basically has good and bad effects. Therefore, as a millennial generation that is literate in technology is expected to not be too immersed in the world of sophistication. If during this time we are given the ease to access something, then we must also have knowledge on how to maintain the stability of the access.Lots of software security systems on the market, but it would be the same if as users we can only see without observing and integrating them. All software security systems are designed to meet all kinds of criteria that users need. The question is, if the user is someone who has a very high level of mobility and also has large-scale projects. Will the user use an ordinary security system? Then the right answer is no. Because if this happens there will be an imbalance. If we compare the high-scale data or project requirements, it must also be protected by a reliable security system.Therefore currently Blocksafe has been present to meet all the criteria given by the user. If some security systems can only be accessed via a desktop screen, then by integrating the Blocksafe system you can also access them via a smartphone. The Blocksafe security system is also called the Cryptodefender. Cryptodefender on the desktop screen has a military grade encryption system. Because of military class, this is of course also followed by cryptodefender found on smart phones. The AES-256 encryption system found on a smartphone is capable of storing userâ€™s personal data stored in a safe by accessing via fingerprint. Each letter that is typed will automatically be encrypted by the Blocksafe system, so this can narrow down the attackerâ€™s motion on various occasions. Did you know that at this time the attackers have a thousand kinds of tactics that will be done to be able to penetrate the security layer on a security system designed by the platform.Currently the main method carried out by the attackers is to create a software program designed to damage the entire operating system platform. This program is usually called Malware, which each malware has a different workmanship effect. This working effect can turn off the operating system slowly or can turn it off suddenly too. This of course depends on the security layer provided on the platform. Therefore currently Blocksafe does not only provide multiple layers of security. But the team of experts also always work together to always renew the existing security system. This was done because the teams realized that the more sophisticated a system was, the greater the attackersâ€™ desire to solve it. Therefore if the expert team does not always monitor and observe closely it is not impossible that undesirable things will happen.In addition to preventing illegal data retrieval, cryptodefender contained in the smartphone system is also able to prevent the automatic storage of data from Malware. Even if users are confused and feel unsure of the password that has been created. So Blocksafe also features a Secure Password Generator that can provide and store passwords securely.Although it has a different name, but all the features possessed by Blocksafe, both for desktop screens and smart phones basically have the same function. For example with the Anti Screen Capture feature that has a function to prevent attackers from capturing desktop screens that contain important data. Similarly, smartphone crytodefender automatically encrypts important data even when the data is typed. It would be useless if the attackers were able to capture the smartphone monitor screen, but no more data could be seen.It is not easy to bring a security system to two different systems. Because automatically experts must also divide the concentration between the two systems. Maybe as users we will see how practical the Blocksafe operating system is. But behind it all there are teams that always work together to embody the real stability of security. Because the quality of a platform is not only seen from the level of sophistication, but also how it can maintain stability despite the many threats that come.Official site: https://blocksafetech.ioWhitepaper: https://blocksafetech.io/BlockSafeWhitepaper.pdfANN: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5100884Bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5152435.0Telegram: https://t.me/officialblocksafetechnologystoâ€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€”Bitcointalk username: ImanmudaETH adress : 0x592C3c1E55cea51529221F5f32b287c31a8a0bCBBitcointalk profile : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2538358;sa=summary----Iman muda--Iman muda--Iman muda--Iman muda--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

After analyzing the cost-benefits of eschewing cash for each city stakeholder, our ThoughtLab team found that increasing digital payments could result in total direct net benefits of US$470 billion per year across the 100 cities. That boils down to about $4.7 billion in net benefits to each city per year â€” the equivalent to about 3% of each cityâ€™s average GDP.Cashless Cities: Realizing the benefits of digital payments also found that these gains work in a virtuous circle to drive wider catalytic benefits for the local economy. Specifically, our analysis shows that the increased use of digital payments could add 19 basis points to a cityâ€™s GDP growth rate over the next 15 years â€” equivalent to nearly $12 trillion in additional economic activity.â€‹Our research methods included:Our findings were conclusive: no matter where they are on the digital payments maturity curve, cities will reap many benefits from reducing their use of cash.

Whether through raw access to information, or simply interconnectedness created by free tools to interact with anyone in the world, the global ecomonic landscape has dramatically shifted. In my own business we have developers in India and Argentina, teams in the Phillipines, and remote employees across the country.While this gives us access to inexpensive labor, it has also created a path to economic security for people that live in environments where this would otherwise be impossible.But, we hire them at $15/hr, a huge cost savings for us, but more importantly an opportunity for a Phillipino with a laptop and access to the internet to almost 4x their annual income by working with U.S. businesses.This causes me to wonder how a ban to a critical tool to development, such as GitHub, impacts developers living in sanctioned nations, and by extension the companies they may do work with. Imagine a freelance developer in Iran, unable to work in his home country or simply one that has found outsized economic gains due to his effectiveness in offshoring his labor suddenly being cut-off from his main codebase. The business he works with will likely be impacted, but they will be able to secure alernative development resources. But the worker himself may be found without access to the critical tools he uses to make a living.Not only is the United States strangling the sanctioned nations (intentionally, because thatâ€™s what sanctions are for) through their physical goods restrictions, but seeing this extend to digital could have some interesting repercussions. While workers themselves may be impacted, I wonder how many entrepreneuers or technologists that rely on internet infrastructure to support their products will be affected by this legislation. What are the long term economic impacts of removing access to core toolsets that underly much of what we use on the internet, and certainly much of what goes into new technology companies?The internet has changed a lot in the last decade or so. We went from a place without walls, and with thousands of sites and content distributed across all of them of varying quality, to a walled off garden of platforms like Youtube and Facebook controlling the vast majority of traffic, and imposing their own rules on what content is allowed to be posted there.There is an incredible podcast episode by Reply All (my favorite podcast) that talks about the impact of algorithm changes by Youtube upon the rise of exremist views and the nature of the content that gets created on the platform itself. Just by optimizing what content is shown for different variables, youtube drives massive changes in human behavior on the platform, and ultimately on the consumption of the content that is posted there.The internet is largely controlled by the U.S. and these platforms specifically even more centralized in California (and even more centrally in San Francisco and Silicon Valley). The decentralized freedom of the internet at large appears to be on a trend towards more centralized and regulated platforms, whether that comes in the form of the state or the companies themselves.----Connor Jeffers--2Connor Jeffers--Connor Jeffers--Connor Jeffers--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Alex Mathers--220HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

(Google even has a Google Opinion Rewards router meter for a similar purpose.)In response to the findings, the company has moved swiftly to disable the app and tender an unequivocal apology. â€œThe Screenwise Meter iOS app should not have operated under Appleâ€™s developer enterprise program â€” this was a mistake, and we apologize. We have disabled this app on iOS devices,â€ said the company in a statement to TechCrunch.If itâ€™s any consolation, Google has at least been more upfront about its data collection practices, and its direct involvement unlike Facebook, which engaged in clever subterfuge by not even giving the app a proper icon. But questions surrounding privacy and consent still loom large.Yes, both Facebookâ€™s Research and Googleâ€™s Screenwise are fully opt-in, and users explicitly consent to them prior to â€œinstallingâ€ the apps. But given tech companiesâ€™ ravenous appetite for personal information and 2018â€™s unsettling string of data breaches and privacy violations, is luring people to sell their privacy with financial rewards the right approach? Do users fully understand the privacy implications?While Facebook says parental consent is required for minors aged 13â€“17, BBC journalist Dave Lee reported as being able to sign up for the â€œresearch projectâ€ as a 14-year-old boyâ€¦ with two kids. â€œI thought Iâ€™d see how robust the parental control for Facebookâ€™s programme is. In less than five minutes I was able to sign up as a 14-year-old boyâ€¦ with two kids. It required no proof of parental consent at all. Iâ€™ve just been sent a link to download the iOS app,â€ Lee tweeted.By incentivising gullible users (teens, in particular) to sign up for the data-grab-disguised-as-a-social-media-study in return for cash (and possibly more, if they referred their friends), the whole episode demands we look at consent in fresh light, especially at a time when consumers remain poorly informed about privacy policies, instead often choosing to agree to the terms and conditions without really knowing what they are agreeing to.That, and establishing better transparency will go a long way towards instilling trust among users, even if they donâ€™t mind sharing their personal data with them in exchange for benefits, and even if they are resigned to the idea that companies collect more data about them than they realise. After all, itâ€™s the digital quid pro quo all of us signed up for.----Computational journalist and cybersecurity reporterRavie Lakshmanan--1Ravie Lakshmanan--1Ravie Lakshmanan--1Ravie Lakshmanan--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

You and your comrades in arms will have to battle against the forces of the evil Rat Menace whoâ€™ve overtaken Old Earth.The game will feature competitive and cooperative modes, and a map editor with the Early Access version (coming Fall 2019), with the campaign being released with the full version of the game. If you want to stay in the loop you should visit our Website and join our DiscordSo the biggest addition to the game this week is being able to jump around in the world. We added this because behind the scenes in the code there was already so much going on behind the scenes to give the illusion of isometric 3D that we might as well commit to it and make stuff collide and process logic with an actual Z-axis in mind.We are excited about this design-wise because this affords many things in the realm of level designSo under the hood of Super Hamster Havoc, actual 3D collisions are taking place. All objects have an X, Y, and Z axis, as well as heights, collision volumes, etc. This is important because we are making this game in Gamemaker Studio 2 (An amazing but not exactly 3D Engine) and it doesnâ€™t come with 3D collisions. However, it makes pixel art look awesome, we already several months into this, and Iâ€™m very stubborn so we wrote a 3D collision function and began replacing all the 2D collision checks with 3D ones. This exposed a few things to me that I really should fix:My solution was to make a base object (because Gamemaker has yet to add classes) that has all the typical behaviors that any object in a level would have and make children that build upon those specific behaviors (an Entity Base, Projectile Base, Prop Base, etc). This means that everything works with 3D collision and new things can be added with minimal effort, and have whatever behaviors that the base object has. The development of the base object, tweaking 3D Collisions and rewriting depth sorting took about a week, but has made development a lot easier moving forward because basic things only have to be added/tweaked in one place. With that said, I added a fancy inspector in the debug mode of the game that Iâ€™m quite happy with (See GIF above).Feel free to scold me in the comments for being a bad coder monkey.----Soulcade Interactive is an Independent Video Game Company with a focus on games that move people and last long.Soulcade Interactive--Soulcade Interactive----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

We all know why, so I wonâ€™t bore you with the details that it was for survival, to stand guard against predators, increase chances of successful hunts, and much more. Instead, Iâ€™d like to fast forward a bit, in fact, a whole lot! Letâ€™s fast forward to today, or rather the last several years.As technology has expanded its footprint into peopleâ€™s every waking moment, contributing to accidents on the road, and even in malls, we have become increasingly more isolated from one another, and people across the country are reporting alarmingly high numbers of loneliness. Even though we are plugged in to different social media communities and project an outward image of community, we are in fact not so connected. This applies more so to the younger generation than older ones. I do not believe that you have to give one up in order to succeed in the other. You do not have to give up your tweets, your TikToks, or more, in order to have meaningful connections in the real world. In fact, the opposite is true. And I will share a personal journey of mine to highlight this fact.In July 29, 2019, I was laid off from the company I was working with along with others at the organization. This was when my wife was 7 months pregnant, with a due date of October 3, 2019. I immediately posted in our San Diego Tech Hub Slack channel that I had gotten laid off, and the response I got was overwhelmingly positive. And of course when things go sideways they really take a left turn as they did for us with our son deciding to be born 7.5 weeks early. So getting laid off was in some ways a blessing in disguise as it allowed me the luxury of being in the hospital with my wife and son, while meeting the needs of our daughter. All the while the SDTH community kept me plugged in, they kept messaging me, and more. It is a community that has combined real world interactions with technology and I believe that this is the path forward across our country in order to create meaningful connections and using technology in the right way. This is why I joined Claude in 2018 to help build out this community. To make it something that meant something for someone. I was now at the recieving end by the kindness and generosity of our community that humbled me beyond mere words. And for that I will be eternally grateful.If you live in the San Diego area, come join our community on both Slack, in person, and to our many programs such as MentorBot, Be the Boss Program, and much more. If you do not live here, learn from us, find a community in your area that does what we do, and if you cannot find it, build it! If you need help along the way on how we did it, reach out to us on our Slack channel, or just message one of us individually on LinkedIn, Twitter, or otherwise.Until next time,Yashar----4x startup founder, technologist, product obsessed, and sometimes a story tellerâ€¦Yashar Ahmadpour--Yashar Ahmadpour--Yashar AhmadpourinAdvice Analytics--Yashar AhmadpourinAdvice Analytics--Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--268Unbecoming--764The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alex Mathers--219Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--165Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--118HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Potential clients get the answers they need, and customer service agents can spend more time making sales instead of answering simple questions. Itâ€™s a win-win.It boosts SEOBusinesses invest a lot in SEO, knowing it improves their online rankings, but why relegate critical keywords to obscure blog entries or product description pages that a potential client may not see when long tail keywords are a perfect fit for an FAQ page?Use the questions clients ask search engines the most, and then format replies with similar keywords.

Now Iâ€™ll talk a little about some of the details and how things are progressing.Tokyo is an amazing LGBTQ subculture of its own. As a friend of mine put it, â€œNi-chome (the queer district here) is one of the largest queer spaces in Asia. When you walk through the streets, you feel like you belong.â€ As opposed to other cities where districts are sometimes a few, spread out bars, Tokyo has a diversity of choices when it comes to nightlife and partying in the LGBTQ sphere.Tokyo also tends to have more public spaces in which people can relax. As a culture comparison, when friends want to hang out in America, theyâ€™re invited over to a personal home. Japan in general has less space to host, so when people want to hang out there are many different cafes, hotel lobbies and parks for friends to use.The growing LGBTQ culture here mixed with nearby cafes for meeting makes this a perfect environment for testing Queery.Queery is a digital pplication that connects groups of three/four people together for interest-based conversations in queer-friendly spaces.Small, manageable groups in a low-pressure environment allows people to connect in a friendly way to build connections in the queer community.Itâ€™s also an experiment to see if we can buck the trend of people putting all their emotional needs onto their partners instead of relying on friends and other community members to fulfill different needs for prolonged happiness. Navigating the world can be a minefield for us, and we need friends and support there holding our hands when things get rough.Itâ€™s also an opportunity to make a cool thing just for the LGBTQ community. We love you. We want to make stuff for you.We also decided to change our name. We needed a name that would work well in both English and Japanese, and so I was torn about whether to change the name. When I say the word ã‚¯ã‚¤ã‚¢ in Japanese, it was a 50/50 chance as to whether or not people understood or needed more explanation. The term â€œqueerâ€ hasnâ€™t caught on to my knowledge, and the play-on-words of â€œqueryâ€ and â€œqueeryâ€ were lost in Japanese. So I started canvassing other types of initiatives here in Tokyo and found one thing in common â€” the word â€œrainbow.â€ (ãƒ¬ã‚¤ãƒ³ãƒœãƒ¼)The rainbow flag was conceived in the United States, yet has been adopted worldwide as a flag for the LGBTQ community. Itâ€™s a global symbol of the queer community and the idea of rainbow crosses cultural bounds. So we adopted a more global name â€” Project Rainbow. It works well in both English and Japanese and speaks to the fact that this is an experiment in a new way of communicating amongst the community, hence â€œProject.â€ I like to think of a project as a thing that is made by the community working together.We currently only have the name â€” no branding. However, taking influence from Queeryâ€™s original visual design explorations (thanks to work done by Alex Wykoff and myself) Iâ€™m wanting the trans/intersex/bisexual colors to be more prominently featured to bring visibility to our friends and partners in the queer community who comprise the B, T, Q, I and A of our community. (bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual or agender) I havenâ€™t forgotten that first and foremost, Project Rainbow is designed first for the T, Q, I and A folks of the LGBTQIA group, and we will be reflecting this not just in our visual design but our interaction design as well (making sure our users are not â€œoutedâ€ on our platform â€” respecting pronouns and chosen names, etc.).And finallyâ€¦Hereâ€™s what Project Rainbow needs right now â€” you lovely people! Weâ€™re looking to find connectors and organizers in the Tokyo LGBTQ community who are willing to take some time out of their busy day to talk with us about how we can improve the community.Weâ€™re looking to test our assumptions and make something tailored for the LGBTQ community in Tokyo and we need your feedback and opinions. If youâ€™re interested in gettting in touch, tweet me or contact us via mail. If you are interested in becoming involved in the project, let me know and I will invite you to our Project Rainbow Slack.Thank you again.

Our most impactful festival ever, the conversation not only set the stage for our ongoing focus on experiential and immersive art, but served as an ideal moment for a major announcement as Gray Area enters its second decade of redefining the relationship between art, technology, and culture.With a deep admiration for her years of outstanding leadership and dedication, we announce Gray Area Founder Josette Melchorâ€™s transition from her position as Executive Director. Melchor will be joining the new future cities initiative at The We Company as their Head of Cultural Programming, while remaining a vital part of Gray Areaâ€™s team as Artistic Director at large and member of the Board of Directors. As we conduct a search for a new, exceptionally qualified Executive Director, Gray Area will be led through its transition by long-time Board Member Barry Threw as Interim Executive Director.â€œAt a very young age, I set out to create an arts institution that could live beyond me,â€ Melchor said. â€œGray Area has always been an act of community service to bridge fields in order to spark ideas into forward-thinking artwork, people, and action. As the Head of Cultural Programming for the future cities initiative, I will be on an interdisciplinary team of engineers, architects, data scientists, biologists, and economists working alongside communities to develop new products to improve the lives of citizens. Effectively, with this shift, I am extending Gray Areaâ€™s model of regenerative culture to the corporate sector, in a broader investment to serve communities.â€Josette Melchor founded Gray Area over 16 years ago as a curatorial project and DIY live/work space created to serve communities. In 2008, she led the effort to incorporate the organization into a 501(c)3 nonprofit, while transforming a former adult theatre into a digital art gallery on San Franciscoâ€™s worst block in the Tenderloin district. From there, Melchor has stewarded the organization through several locations, culminating five years ago in the revitalization of the historic 1940s Grand Theater in the Mission District, its home to this day. Along the way, she enacted her pioneering vision of a living creative hub for the integrated practice of art and technology, a uniquely San Franciscan institution globally recognized for its forward-looking programming around events, education, and cultural incubation.Melchorâ€™s background as a queer, third-generation Mexican-American has grounded her deep commitment to safeguarding diverse communities in the midst of a rapidly gentrifying San Francisco. She led Gray Areaâ€™s role as a first responder to the tragic Ghostship fire, launching the Oakland Fire Fund to serve hundreds of those affected by the tragedy. Her direction resulted in many groundbreaking programs redefining the role of an arts institution in economic and civic fabric. In collaboration with the City of San Francisco, she created the first Urban Prototyping Festival in 2012, creating a platform for citizens to address civic issues through public activations, which has since been copied worldwide. In 2016, Melchor instigated the first exhibition that paired artificial neural networks with artists, which helped establish the Artists and Machine Intelligence program at Google, ushering in a new movement in Artificial Intelligence assisted artwork. She most recently spearheaded the development of Gray Areaâ€™s Knight Foundation-supported Experiential Space Research Lab, developing sustainable models for artists to work within the quickly evolving format of immersive experiences.â€œI am forever indebted to all who have supported the vision of Gray Area and to those who carry it onward,â€ said Melchor. â€œIt has become a place, a community, an ecosystem of its own, and its impact has exceeded my wildest expectations, making this the perfect moment for a new wave of direction to drive the organization forward. I am excited to remain a collaborator, Artistic Director, and a Board Member of Gray Area, but I couldnâ€™t think of a more perfect human to lead the organization towards its next phase of growth than my confidant and colleague Barry Thew. In many ways, Mr. Threw has already been quietly driving the organization forward, through curation of the Gray Area Festival and continuous strategic support. The Staff, Board, and Myself have the utmost trust and respect in his leadership through this transition.â€Threwâ€™s appointment as Interim Executive Director marks an acceleration to the next phase of Gray Areaâ€™s development at a crucial moment for San Francisco. He comes with over fifteen years of experience building innovative, influential products, experiences, teams, and businesses ranging across art, built environment, and creative technologies, with organizations ranging from San Franciscoâ€™s Recombinant Media Labs and Obscura Digital, to the Vatican.He enters the Executive Director role with over a decade of experience volunteering with Gray Area on every level of its operations. With his previous focus on Strategic Partnerships, he has built relationships with artist institutions, corporations, and foundations internationally that will provide the network of collaborators necessary to elevate Gray Areaâ€™s presence as a global thought leader in the arts. In addition, his curation and development of the Gray Area Festival over its five-year run has demonstrated an ability to lead the global conversation around arts, technology, and culture.â€œGray Area holds a critical role in the conversation around innovation not only because it safe-guards community and culture locally, but because San Franciscoâ€™s worldview is exported globally,â€ Threw said. â€œThe extractive technology practices in San Francisco have caused an erosion of the cultural foundations that made us the global capital of technology. My friend and colleague Josette Melchor pioneered a better collaboration between technology and culture here, and I am honored and excited to carry our work forward, developing the infrastructure, business models, and partnerships necessary to continue our mission of applying art and technology toward engaging with the most important challenges facing us, and ultimately showing a more holistic and responsible way leverage the arts in building technology for the good of our world.â€These changes come as Gray Area enters a pivotal moment in our history. We have grown from a small start-up digital arts gallery, to an internationally recognized organization pioneering new models of regenerative innovation. Along the way, we have pushed the boundaries of what types of impact an arts organization can make, bridging creative communities while developing business models for artists to sustain their practice in a hostile economy undervaluing their role. Meanwhile, Gray Area has sustained itself as one of San Franciscoâ€™s few remaining independent cultural centers.The wave of art and technology practice that we helped lead has gained global traction, resulting in a worldwide movement of artistic thinkers critically examining the effects of technology on our world, and creatively reimagining paths forward to some of the biggest problems facing humanity. To build upon this foundation and increase momentum into our next decade, we usher in fresh new ideas and leadership to remain at the forefront of the rapidly changing conversation around technology and culture. We thank our community for your steadfast support and for joining us in this next stage of our journey.----Gray Area is a 501(c)3 nonprofit in San Francisco, CA applying art & technology to create positive social impact. #grayareaorg #creativecodeGray Area Foundation--Gray Area FoundationinExperiental Space Research Lab--Gray Area FoundationinExperiental Space Research Lab--Gray Area FoundationinExperiental Space Research Lab--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Entre las mas conocidas que ofrecen tarjetas de dÃ©bito o crÃ©dito estÃ¡n UalÃ¡, Mercado pago, Brubank y Wilobank.Pero como dice el tÃ­o Ben: â€œUn gran poder conlleva una gran responsabilidad.â€AsÃ­ es, una tarjeta, sea del tipo que fuera, es una responsabilidad muy grande. Ya que puedes intercambiar tu plata, que ganaste con tu trabajo y acceder a prÃ¡cticamente lo que quieras que se pueda comprar por internet.Si nunca has manejado una tarjeta puedes mandarte macanas, ya sea mostrar datos importantes y dejarse clonar la tarjeta, comprar en pÃ¡ginas inseguras, meterse en deudas o problemas legales.Por eso quiero hablar de recomendaciones al momento de hacer una compra.Antes de pagar por un servicio de cobro mensual (Netflix, Spotify, etc) piensa si vas a tener para pagar todos los meses. Ya que estos cobran de forma automÃ¡tica de tu tarjeta, AUNQUE LA TENGAS CONGELADA. Por eso pregÃºntate si es algo necesario antes de pagar. En caso que la tarjeta se quede sin saldo, se te notificarÃ¡ algo como ""El cobro fue rechazado"", pero dependerÃ¡ del servicio si sigue intentando hasta que cargues o se te darÃ¡ te baja automÃ¡ticamente.Para asegurarte que no tengas problemas. Si quieres dar de baja un servicio debes ir planeando con anticipaciÃ³n, entrar a la pÃ¡gina del servicio y buscar en configuraciÃ³n de la cuenta para darte de baja de buena manera.Algo que te darÃ¡ mayor confianza al momento de pagar es comprar en pÃ¡ginas verificadas. FÃ­jate arriba donde esta el link de la pagina, a la izquierda hay un candado, eso significa que es un sitio encriptado. Las grandes marcas seguro lo tienen y algunas mÃ¡s. Ayuda a prevenir paginas maliciosas que buscan robar informaciÃ³n. Puede pasar que algÃºn comercio pequeÃ±o no tenga este sÃ­mbolo todavÃ­a, no quiere decir que ellos robaran tu informaciÃ³n pero ya corre por tu cuenta.Por eso cuando hagas una compra por internet, verifica que se trate de un sitio seguro.TambiÃ©n cuando compres algo a alguien que no conozcas asegura que se trate de una persona de confianza.Si nunca tuviste tarjeta, dÃ©jame decirte que si alguien tiene la cara frontal de tu tarjeta ya tiene casi toda la informaciÃ³n para usarla sin que te des cuenta. Ya que en el dorso sÃ³lo hay tres nÃºmeros, quedando muy vulnerable.Por eso nunca compartas tu datos de la tarjeta en publico. Me refiero a los nÃºmeros que estÃ¡n atrÃ¡s y adelante.Pueden pasar dos cosas, atento aquÃ­. Tienes que fijarte de donde viene ese cobro. Cuando compras algo que viene con IVA, tal vez no se cobre en ese momento, entonces te va a llegar mas tarde una notificaciÃ³n sin tu aviso del cobro del IVA. Muchas veces son difÃ­ciles de leer, es decir no te avisa â€œ esto es el IVA de X productoâ€.Ahora si no compraste nada y te llega un cobro grande (verifica antes que no sea Netflix, Spotify, etc.) entonces deberÃ­as comunicarte con atenciÃ³n al cliente de la tarjeta, puede que haya sido clonada. Congela la tarjeta en ese momento.Absolutamente no, estas protegiendo tus datos. Especialmente si estas en una ciudad turÃ­stica, puedes ser blanco de gente que quiera estafarte. Tampoco es la idea sentirse perseguido, pero es mejor ser precavido.Por eso nunca compartas tus claves ni dejes que te vean cuando las ingresas.Si te llegÃ³ un mail pidiendo esto es claramente un intento de robo de informaciÃ³n.Por eso nunca respondas un mail o llamada que te pidan que les digas los datos de tu tarjeta.Cuando hagas asociar tu tarjeta a una plataforma como Google, Paypal, etc. tal vez te cobre un dolar para verificar que la tarjeta sea valida. Te lo tienen que regresar al momento de validar.

We spoke with one of the companyâ€™s tech leads, Amit Priyadarshi, to see how Fetchr gives him the freedom to experiment and how that has helped him excel in his career. He also explains how learning from the people on the ground who are actually are responsible for making deliveries has influenced the development of their technology, and how that technology is making driversâ€™ jobs easier in return.Interviewer: How has Fetchr and its culture given you the freedom to excel and maximize your potential as a tech lead?Amit Priyadarshi: I joined Fetchr as a software engineer, and the company saw potential in me, so they invested in me and gave me more responsibility. This helped lead to the next career stage for me, tech lead.As a tech lead, there are a few key necessities needed to perform well and excel, or even to elevate your work to the next level. You need to have the freedom to experiment, the freedom to make decisions, and the freedom to decide which new technologies to adopt or not adopt.At the time, the company was in a complex situation. We needed to scale to six times what we currently were, and to achieve that scale, we needed new customers. New customers, of course, mean new strategies and new requirements.In a complex situation such as this, you have to embrace change and be willing to adapt. You have to ensure you are able to scale that drastically while keeping your colleagues happy. As a tech lead, I could not expect them to work all 24 hours in a day. Itâ€™s a challenging position in which to find balance.Thankfully, Fetchr consistently shows trust in me. They believe that Iâ€™m capable of handling this and other difficult circumstances. In the last nine months, we completely revamped our entire app and added almost twenty new features to it. We also were able to accomplish our goal and scale to over six times what we were when we started.Fetchr gave me the freedom to excel at my job and it resulted in a new, improved version of the app. As I was dealing with the problems associated with growth, my managers offered me the right amount of guidance to make the best possible decisions. They empowered me and gave me the opportunity to do my best work, but also were there to help me when I needed it.Interviewer: What was one of the projects you were most involved in since you joined Fetchr?Amit Priyadarshi: Iâ€™ve worked on many projects. In fact, my team and I have worked on more than twenty features. One of the features most dear to me, though, was order-bucketing. It was challenging to really figure out, but ultimately very rewarding.Letâ€™s say a particular driver has fifty orders. In the past, they were kind of using a manual algorithm in their mind to determine which order they should deliver first. There was no optimization. Everything was done in their heads or on paper, and while they had experience, and this experience was translated into their work, our system was not receiving this information. We were not aware of how they were arranging the orders.To solve this problem, I developed a project of order-bucketing. This project gave drivers the freedom to continue arranging their orders, but created communication between those arrangements and our system. Then, we add some machine learning to figure out how they were arranging orders. In other words, what was the pattern?For the last four or five months, we have used this technology to make order delivery arrangements automatically. The drivers still have the freedom to change it, but we are giving them a schedule with which to start. The challenging nature and subsequent success of this project make it one of the best that I have done.Interviewer: Why was it so important for you to make a driverâ€™s experience smooth?Amit Priyadarshi: Drivers are the core of our company. Without them, everything we do is just conceptual. They are the ones who actually are doing what we as a company are trying to do. Fetchr is a delivery company, and they are the ones out in the field actually delivering the packages.Ideally, their entire focus would be on delivering the package. They should not be concerned with the functions of the app. Apps should be obvious and user-friendly. They should be there to enable ease and efficiency. As a tech team, we try to provide our drivers with the best, smoothest experience possible.We accomplished this through thorough research, and a lot of trial and error. We conducted several surveys, experimented with different versions of the app, and figured out which version best facilitated the work of our drivers. Best of all, this development benefits both the drivers and the company. They get to focus on the task at hand, and the company enjoys increased efficiency and employee satisfaction. Every aspect of the process just performs at a higher level.We are Fetchr; a company specialized in e-fulfillment. We help e-commerce entrepreneurs grow their business in the Middle East.

You and your comrades in arms will have to battle against the forces of the evil Rat Menace whoâ€™ve overtaken Old Earth.The game will feature competitive and cooperative modes, and a map editor with the Early Access version (coming Fall 2019), with the campaign being released with the full version of the game. If you want to stay in the loop you should visit our Website and join our DiscordSo the biggest addition to the game this week is being able to jump around in the world. We added this because behind the scenes in the code there was already so much going on behind the scenes to give the illusion of isometric 3D that we might as well commit to it and make stuff collide and process logic with an actual Z-axis in mind.We are excited about this design-wise because this affords many things in the realm of level designSo under the hood of Super Hamster Havoc, actual 3D collisions are taking place. All objects have an X, Y, and Z axis, as well as heights, collision volumes, etc. This is important because we are making this game in Gamemaker Studio 2 (An amazing but not exactly 3D Engine) and it doesnâ€™t come with 3D collisions. However, it makes pixel art look awesome, we already several months into this, and Iâ€™m very stubborn so we wrote a 3D collision function and began replacing all the 2D collision checks with 3D ones. This exposed a few things to me that I really should fix:My solution was to make a base object (because Gamemaker has yet to add classes) that has all the typical behaviors that any object in a level would have and make children that build upon those specific behaviors (an Entity Base, Projectile Base, Prop Base, etc). This means that everything works with 3D collision and new things can be added with minimal effort, and have whatever behaviors that the base object has. The development of the base object, tweaking 3D Collisions and rewriting depth sorting took about a week, but has made development a lot easier moving forward because basic things only have to be added/tweaked in one place. With that said, I added a fancy inspector in the debug mode of the game that Iâ€™m quite happy with (See GIF above).Feel free to scold me in the comments for being a bad coder monkey.----Soulcade Interactive is an Independent Video Game Company with a focus on games that move people and last long.Soulcade Interactive--Soulcade Interactive----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

I would also say we do a shell integration for it (Alternatively tap menu iTerm2 > Make shell integration). This step is not necessary, so donâ€™t worry if you canâ€™t find a suitable Linux variant for it.Run the following command in the terminalAfter installation of zsh, set it as login shell in iTerm2. You may need to run this command:Logout from iTerm2 and then again launch it. Type echo $0 and you will see zsh.Run the following command in the terminalOh-my-zsh has numerous plugins and themes, but probably the most useful is the git integration, which is usually enabled by default. You can find this in your ~/.zshrc file, there is a line like this: plugins=(git). If git is not in the list, then you should add it.

The Internet of Things is a pretty simple concept â€” taking all the things in the world and connecting them to the internet.â€œInternet of Things: the interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.â€This sounds quite terrifying. Why would we need everything connected to the internet?Letâ€™s first think of a typical day in your life. How many internet-connected devices do you already use? Probably a lot more than you realize.Your day starts with the ringing of your smart alarm, which is connected to your phone so it can show you the notifications you received during your beauty sleep. Then you check your smartwatch, which tracked your sleep during the night and lets you know how it was in comparison to other nights, and obviously is also connected to your smartphone so that you can see the meetings you have today at work. You brush your teeth with your smart toothbrush (yes, this actually exists), which somehow tracks your teeth-brushing. You get up and ready for work while yelling â€œAlexa! Whatâ€™s the weather today?â€ so you know what kind of clothes to wear. You turn on the heater in your tesla from your phone because Alexa said itâ€™s quite chilly.(Of course, this â€œtypicalâ€ day is a little extreme, but is absolutely possible in today's world).As you can see, the rest of the day will continue similarly; most of the devices you use are connected to the internet.The Internet of Things as a concept wasnâ€™t officially named until 1999, however devices following this idea already existed.One of the first examples is from the early â€™80s: a Coca-Cola machine located in Carnegie Melon University. Programmers would connect via the Internet to the machine, and check if their preferred drink was available and cold, before heading to the machine.The idea of adding sensors and a connection to the Internet was discussed already a few decades ago, but progress was slow; the technology just didnâ€™t exist yet. As you can tell by the graph, the growth has been exponential for the past ~10 years and more internet-connected devices are being created, very fast.All things connected to the internet can be divided into three categories:To make this more clear, we could use some real-life examples.These devices use sensors (usually) to collect information. For example, a thermostat in your smart home, can measure the temperature in your house and show you the degree on an app on your smartphone.The sensors along with an internet connection allow us to automatically collect information and make smarter decisions based on complex computer algorithms, while not having to interact at all with anything but an internet-connected device.Most of the devices we know operate like this â€” getting information and acting upon it. A printer receives a document to print and prints it. A car unlocks if it receives a signal to unlock.These operations can be as simple as turning on a device from farther away. The real power of the Internet of Things is when these two behaviors can work simultaneously from the same device!Letâ€™s take the example with the thermostat from before; what if it could operate completely on its own? The thermostat measures the temperature, and once the house becomes too hot it automatically lowers the temperature.This way the device is collecting information but also receiving its own information and acting upon it. This is the true power of IoT.Letâ€™s go over one more great example:Farming! How could IoT possibly help us with farming? The first thing to think about is how much human interaction is needed for plants to grow, and if anything could be replaced (and even do a better job) by some internet-connected device. The first thing that comes to mind is the watering system!How does a person know when a plant needs to be watered? When a certain amount of time has passed? When the soil feels dry? These decisions can be made by algorithms from a device that can do all this for us. Letâ€™s say we have an automatic watering system, with sensors in the soil that measure how moist it is. This would be a device collecting information, and we could make it even more advanced by acting upon the information; once the water content in the soil reaches 14%, turn on the sprinklers for 2 minutes.This system can be improved even more; it has access to the internet. It could check the upcoming forecast and see if any rain is coming. If so, it will know not to turn on the watering system today.This is just one type of device with moisture sensors. Think about how many things can be done with all the different types of information that can be collected â€” things that donâ€™t exist yet. With the world today being all about â€˜big dataâ€™, we must find ways to make the smartest decision based on it.Automated Farming might seem less impactful in your personal world, so letâ€™s think of how things can change in your day. Using our â€œtypical dayâ€ story from before, we could think of different ways to improve the use of devices, especially by making them interact with each other (making them â€œsmartâ€™).What if your morning alarm could automatically turn on the coffee machine for it to be ready once you need to leave? What if your smart fridge could take care of your groceries? It could track every food item, and use an app on your smartphone to automatically order more. If these sound a little useless (or lazy for some people), we could think of more significant uses.What if your wearable devices can sense when youâ€™re in danger, and automatically let someone know? What if you have some kind of device that tracks your houseâ€™s energy consumption, and automatically turns different things on or off depending on your usage, saving you thousands of dollars a year?The possibilities are endless.As Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve heard, everything connected to the internet can be hacked (yes, everything), and IoT products are no exception to this rule. With everything being connected to the internet, anything could be hacked and messed with. Following the previous example, one cyberattack could ruin an entire crop in a day.One other issue is the amount of data being stored. If every device is constantly storing all the data itâ€™s collecting, there is a possibility of someone reaching all this data and using it for other purposes.Also, what about your personal privacy? If everything in your house is connected to the internet, everything could be hacked and information about you and your habits come out. With a smart fridge, everything you eat and when you eat will come out. With your smartwatch, every heartbeat and step could be accessible. With almost all devices around you having some kind of sensor (some with cameras), hackers would have access to every aspect of your life.These issues are very serious, and the truth is there isnâ€™t any real solution yet. Different security methods have been released, and these issues are constantly being thought upon:If the whole point of all devices being connected is for them to communicate, we need to find a way to allow that to happen. If all devices run on different standards, theyâ€™re going to struggle to communicate and transfer data to each other.Currently, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Standards Association lists a large number of standards that exist and are being worked on for different devices.Also, Microsoft has started to think about this issue and came up with their own system â€” IoT Central. The system gives businesses a central platform for setting up their IoT devices.To sum things up, revolutionizing the planet with IoT is often thought of as â€œThe 4th Industrial Revolutionâ€, because of how impactful it can be. We should all be aware of the changes happening and the issues they bring, but also appreciate we live in a world where these kinds of changes are possible and are actually happening.Iâ€™m sure lots of people will believe these changes are useless and are meant for â€œspoiledâ€ people (mostly those with more old-fashioned ideologies), but we must think of all the positive impact it can bring, to the extent of saving lives (and even the planet).Feel free to reach out on Twitter @eitanmayer57 http://eitanmayer.com/----The StartupSoftware Engineer in Tel Aviv.

Some, like the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64, are now highly-valued for their stylish designs. But if you want a modern computer, your only real choices are to build your own desktop or purchase a laptop that looks like a slab of aluminum. Luckily, there is another option, and thatâ€™s to follow lewisb42â€™s tutorial to build your own retro-styled Raspberry Pi computer.The design of lewisb42â€™s FLIPT-BIT computer was inspired by a computer Sony built in 1984 called the HIT-BIT HB-101. Like many other computers from the â€™80s, the HB-101 had a built-in keyboard and even a joystick. The FLIPT-BIT follows the same concept, but swaps the joystick for a small touch pad and adds a 7"" TFT display. lewisb42 used a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ for his build, but you should be able to use any full-size Raspberry Pi model, including the new Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.To build your own FLIPT-BIT, youâ€™ll need the Raspberry Pi, 7"" display, a 12V 5A power supply, a 12V to 5V voltage regulator, and a compact USB keyboard and trackpad (both from Perixx). The enclosure is constructed from a combination of 3D-printed parts, acrylic sheet, and foamed PVC sheet. After youâ€™ve got all of your components together and the enclosure finished, the final assembly is as simple as connecting all of the cables. There is plenty of space inside of the case, so you shouldnâ€™t have any trouble making everything fit. The result is a modern computer that looks as good as the classics from the â€™80s!----Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_cowardCameron Coward--Cameron CowardinSerial Hobbyism--Cameron Coward--Cameron Coward--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Gustavo Aguilar--Unbecoming--768Clive Thompson--19Scott H.

With Mercedes taking the most conservative Belgian GP tyre selection (the softest tyres for those who are not in the know), Honda providing Engines to Red Bull and Toto Wolff opposing the DTMâ€™s experiment to shorter race weekends itâ€™s definitely going to be a great event to witness.Formula 1 is awesome. Once you begin streaming, you are presented with an intense battle between teams which consist of top-tier engineers, pilots and cold-blooded decision makers. It may look that itâ€™s just a bunch of cute little cars with monstrous engines capable of 15000 rpm, but itâ€™s way more than your eye first beholds. Trust me.You can find out where you can stream F1 Live at their official website. However folks that already have a subscription to a particular streaming service which is already offering F1 Live streams but for a reason are not at their home country but travelling in another can find it to be a bit tricky to access live streams due to the fact that most of the streaming services do not allow non-residents of the country to access their content.For example, ESPN â€” a US sports streaming service is only allowing their content to be watched inside of the US. The only way you will be able to access ESPN outside of US is with the help of a VPN server.A VPN server is an intermediary server between your destination and your computer. VPN serverâ€™s purpose is to encrypt your traffic and make sure you stay secure online. Your IP address is also being changed. This is one of the main advantages and reasons of popularity of the VPNâ€” when you change your IP address, you appear as if youâ€™re browsing from a completely different country thus you can avoid geo-restrictions.Here are some VPN providers that are noteworthy of attention:NordVPN ($3.49/month for 3 year subscription)This VPN provider has a built-in adblocker that protects you from adware, perfectly works with streaming services such as Netflix and despite of using Military Grade encryption your Internet speed wonâ€™t be affected much (you speed will decrease by 20% at most)NordVPN has more than 5000 servers in 60+ countries meaning that you can connect to almost any place in the world. Your traffic isnâ€™t logged.NordVPN itself operates and answers by the laws of Panama meaning that your data isnâ€™t collected and sold to the highest bidder. Want to watch the streams on your phone? No problem, Android and iOS are at your disposal too.ExpressVPN ($8.32/month for 1 year)One of the Fastest VPNs in the world.Remarkably reliable and consistent, whether youâ€™re connecting to a local server, or one on the other side of the world.Private Internet Access ($3.33/month for 1 year)Private Internet Access is a VPN that pays close attention to anonymity and affordability, and in both areas it is a compelling offering. However, key areas for improvement include support for an even broader range of platforms, such as the popular Apple TV, and introducing more servers located in a more geographically diverse number of countries.Whatever you do â€” donâ€™t visit shady looking streaming websites. They might provide streams of the most lucrative football matches, hottest fights, basically you get to see any big sporting event for free, but in exchange for that you can catch a virus after interacting with one of their malicious ads.Compromising websites that have high traffic by finding a vulnerability in their underlying software requires more effort than simply attacking their ad network(s) whose security practices might not be on the same level.In fact, many advertisers contract out to third parties, which in turn may outsource to others, thus creating an insecure chain of intermediaries where one weak link can take everybody down.One common misconception with malvertising is that you must click the ad in order to get infected. Although it can be true, there are malicious ads that can infect your browser just by loading up on it, meaning that the presence of the ad on a website can be dangerous.----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Tanto se fala de sua importÃ¢ncia, as vÃ¡rias aplicaÃ§Ãµes, os diversos canais, mas, quando chega o momento de colocarmos a mÃ£o na massa, muitas dÃºvidas surgem. Acompanhe-nos neste artigo que vocÃª sairÃ¡ daqui sabendo como criar um assistente virtual sob medida para as necessidades e aspiraÃ§Ãµes da sua empresa!Antes de qualquer coisa, Ã© preciso ter em mente que embora estejamos â€œsimulandoâ€ uma conversa, existem particularidades que nÃ£o devem ser ignoradas. Diferente do que acontece quando batemos um papo com um amigo ou colega de trabalho, em que nÃ£o â€œprocessamosâ€ detalhadamente as informaÃ§Ãµes para formularmos uma resposta (bom, nÃ£o conscientemente, pelo menos), com o assistente virtual Ã© diferente. Por nÃ£o saber â€œimprovisarâ€ ou reagir de forma â€œnaturalâ€, Ã© necessÃ¡rio que mapeemos as interaÃ§Ãµes a fim de garantir a melhor experiÃªncia.FluxogramaE aÃ­, chegamos a um ponto crucial para entender como criar um assistente virtual: o fluxograma. Embora a palavra soe como algo muito complicado, na realidade vocÃª precisa apenas de um papel, uma caneta e a conversa mais ou menos clara na sua cabeÃ§a. A ideia aqui, Ã© evitar que vocÃª entre na plataforma sem os caminhos que o bot percorrerÃ¡ mais ou menos estruturados e enfrente a famigerada â€œtela brancaâ€ (acontece, a gente sabe).Para tanto, Ã© preciso que esteja claro para vocÃª e seu time qual a missÃ£o principal do chatbot. CaptaÃ§Ã£o de leads? Filtrar o fluxo de usuÃ¡rios e fazer o transbordo para alguÃ©m da equipe? Tirar dÃºvidas frequentes dos consumidores sobre seu produto ou serviÃ§o? Tenha em mente que o fim da conversa sempre serÃ¡ o cumprimento desse objetivo principal.O segundo passo, entÃ£o, Ã© pensar nos diferentes caminhos que o usuÃ¡rio percorrerÃ¡. Sente-se com seu time e, se necessÃ¡rio, com as demais Ã¡reas envolvidas no projeto para alinhar as funcionalidades que o assistente virtual disponibilizarÃ¡ para seus interlocutores. Exemplo: se vocÃª estiver fazendo um chatbot que tem a missÃ£o de captar leads interessados em um certo produto, crie um â€œcaminhoâ€ que explore os diferenciais e particularidades que possivelmente farÃ£o o pÃºblico conhecer e se interessar ainda mais pela compra. Storytelling, para usar um termo da moda.MÃ£o na massaFeito o fluxograma, Ã© hora de partir para a plataforma. Na Cosmobots, essa Ã© a parte mais fÃ¡cil. Nosso builder Ã© pensado para ser o mais intuitivo possÃ­vel, ou seja, atÃ© quem nunca criou um assistente virtual antes consegue sair de lÃ¡ com um prontinho pra ser testado â€” e como estamos sempre atualizando e promovendo melhorias, a tendÃªncia Ã© que a experiÃªncia fique cada vez mais proveitosa.Lembra dos â€œcaminhosâ€ que comentamos anteriormente? Aqui, eles entram em cena novamente. Uma das formas mais prÃ¡ticas de organizar o esqueleto da conversa Ã© dividi-lo em caminhos em distintos. Isso facilita o entendimento das aÃ§Ãµes do assistente virtual e torna o trabalho de toda a equipe mais fluido â€” afinal, com o raciocÃ­nio claro, fica fÃ¡cil atÃ© pra quem nÃ£o estÃ¡ no projeto entender o planejamento por trÃ¡s da criaÃ§Ã£o do assistente virtual.Com os fluxos criados, Ã© hora de dar uma atenÃ§Ã£o especial ao texto. Antes de comeÃ§ar a escrever, Ã© muito importante ter muito claro quem Ã© o pÃºblico que vai interagir com o chatbot e, a partir daÃ­, pesquisar em diferentes canais como ele se comunica. Esse conhecimento garante que a persona do assistente virtual crie mais proximidade com usuÃ¡rio, aumente a retenÃ§Ã£o e torne a experiÃªncia mais rica e prazerosa.AlÃ©m disso, a linguagem correta evita uma sÃ©rie de situaÃ§Ãµes indesejadas, como dispersÃ£o do pÃºblico, dificuldade de compreensÃ£o das mensagens, inteligÃªncia artificial deficiente, entre muitas outras. Vale lembrar que, por mais que as pessoas saibam que estÃ£o conversando com um assistente virtual, esperam ser entendidas e terem seus problemas resolvidos de modo objetivo e eficiente.Entendendo e treinando a NLPOutro passo muito importante quando estamos entendendo como criar um assistente virtual Ã© o Processamento de Linguagem Natural, ou Natural Language Processing (NLP), em inglÃªs. Basicamente, Ã© ela que garante que o bot entenderÃ¡ as perguntas e respostas enviadas a ele.Nas etapas com campos abertos, ou seja, quando o usuÃ¡rio tem a opÃ§Ã£o de digitar uma mensagem direcionada ao assistente virtual, Ã© essencial que haja a intenÃ§Ã£o correspondente. Assim, evitamos que a conversa caia no frustrante fluxo de exceÃ§Ã£o, quando o bot diz nÃ£o entender o que estÃ¡ sendo dito.Para facilitar a criaÃ§Ã£o de assistentes virtuais, na plataforma da Cosmobots a NLP Ã© dividida em intenÃ§Ãµes e entidades. As primeiras, sÃ£o compostas de frases e expressÃµes que vocÃª identificou como sendo frequentemente ditas pelo pÃºblico que vai interagir com o chatbot. Vale lembrar que eventuais erros de digitaÃ§Ã£o e de ortografia sÃ£o comuns e devem sempre ser considerados.As entidades, por outro lado, sÃ£o palavras que serÃ£o muito repetidas durante a conversa. Por exemplo, se vocÃª tem uma empresa de aluguel de vans, termos como â€œvanâ€, â€œaluguelâ€ e â€œpassageirosâ€ serÃ£o fortes candidatos. O papel das entidades Ã© â€œfortalecerâ€ a compreensÃ£o do assistente virtual, enriquecendo a NLP e melhorando a experiÃªncia do usuÃ¡rio.RelatÃ³rios e AnÃ¡lise de dadosFluxos criados, interaÃ§Ãµes estruturadas, NLP treinadasâ€¦ SÃ³ deixar o bot interagir com o pÃºblico, certo? Errado! Quando pensamos em como criar um assistente virtual, devemos lembrar sempre que o trabalho vai alÃ©m: Ã© fundamental monitorar, de tempos em tempos, as conversas e os dados que elas geram.Com a extraÃ§Ã£o dos relatÃ³rios, vocÃª terÃ¡ informaÃ§Ãµes super valiosas sobre seu negÃ³cio, clientes e prospects e como ambos interagem entre si. NÃ£o sÃ³, com a anÃ¡lise surgem os mais importantes e poderosos insights, que se bem aplicados, trazem mais clareza Ã  resoluÃ§Ã£o de problemas â€” alÃ©m de iluminar oportunidades que costumam passar despercebidas.Na era do marketing 3.0, ter uma ferramenta que possibilita avaliar as expectativas, visÃµes e feedbacks individuais de cada usuÃ¡rio Ã© primordial. Viu sÃ³? O chatbot pode, entre muitas outras coisas, ser um Ã³timo canal para ouvir o seu pÃºblico.Agora que vocÃª jÃ¡ sabe como criar um assistente virtual, chegou o momento de explorar todo esse universo de oportunidades.

Many others have beat this horse to death, so Iâ€™ll just add that if I have to watch 20 erectile dysfunction drug commercials per sporting event I think the attendees of CES could probably handle a sexual pleasure device for women.Tim Kadlec published a provocative article asking us to consider if web application performance is an ethical concern. Kadlec makes a compelling case that it is for two main reasons â€” exclusion and waste. Slow and bloated apps run horrifically slow on lower cost hardware, even brand-new, low-price-point phones and computers. Anyone with low end hardware or low end connection speeds is essentially locked out of using apps with poor performance.Then, thereâ€™s waste. Modern infrastructure and cloud services make it easy to forget the astronomical electricity costs associated with serving and running websites. Plus, poor performance plays into planned obsolescence, incentivising users to continue throwing away old computers and phones, which is fast becoming an ecological nightmare. Kadlecâ€™s article reminds me of Nikita Prokopovâ€™s Software Disenchantment, which dives into the details of just how slow and bloated software has become in recent years.Motherboard reported on an interesting data privacy vulnerability that highlights some of the more human aspects of the problem. Joseph Cox describes how he paid a bounty hunter $300 dollars to locate a phone based on that phoneâ€™s number. The story exposes how big telecom companies and our legal system are part of a convoluted system of sketchy data brokerage. Itâ€™s a great read, and another example of how much work we have ahead of us in the world of data privacy.Finally, another blow was dealt to the already deflating cryptocurrency bubble when hackers successfully forced a fork on the Ethereum Classic blockchain. This attack â€” sometimes called a â€œ51%â€ attack â€” allows attackers to double spend coins and, according to Coinbase security engineer Mark Nesbitt, $1.1M dollars worth of Ethereum Classic has already been double spent. This has always been a risk with blockchain technology, as I wrote back in August.This is a significant blow, and to me exposes the misnomer behind the idea of â€œtrustlessâ€ transaction systems. Users may not have to trust other people making transactions, but they do place their trust in the technology. Now, with the knowledge that it is indeed possible to fork the Ethereum Classic blockchain, users will have to decide if they still trust the decentralized system to be powered by at least 51% good-faith actors.This article is part of our weekly newsletter.

He loves to meet and help early-stage companies become household names. He caught up with us today to share his top tips for startups wanting to pitch at Collision â€” our North American conference which will take place in Toronto this May.In the three years Iâ€™ve been with Collision, Iâ€™ve worked with startups and investors from every corner of the world, and in every industry you can imagine. And Iâ€™ve learned that oftentimes, there are some very simple dos and donâ€™ts when it comes to getting your message to the right people at our events.Youâ€™ll find countless articles, videos and podcasts extolling the best way to pitch. So, letâ€™s take a slightly different approach here. Looking through the lens of our event, how can you really get the most out of it? While nobody knows your business better than you, there are a few guaranteed steps which, from my experience, are likely to work.Here are my tips for tackling the common avenues startups use to reach those that matter.First off, who are you pitching to? Most early-stage founders allow their minds to drift to investors at events like Collision. And thatâ€™s natural. But your next key hire, a mentor, a customer, the company that acquires you â€” they could all be there. You just donâ€™t know who youâ€™ll meet at Collision.I would group your targets into four categories:Customers- Pretty self-explanatory. But think big. Donâ€™t limit your pitches to those who are a direct fit right now as a customer. Who are the customers of tomorrow? Get on their radar early.Investors- Always in demand with our attending startups. Arguably some of the busiest people to track down at our events. If you arrange investor meetings, use them wisely!Media- We are known for bringing top-tier media from around the world. And they are always on the hunt for a unique angle or something novel that makes you stand out from the crowd. Adjust your pitch accordingly.Key hires/Mentors/Partners- A future CFO or Head of Sales? Your next key hire is out there. Build those connections early.Short and sweet is the name of the game here. Nobody likes walls of text. Explain who you are, what you do and what your ask is.But first, make sure you are messaging the right people. Every year I open my app to many messages from people asking me for funding or how their product is a fit for. As much as Iâ€™d like to think someone has singled me out as possessing the perfect set of skills and capital to make me their dream investor or customer â€” I know and you know, they havenâ€™t done much research.Collision will be the home of many high-profile investors, media and industry leaders from across the globe. And that will mean nothing to you if you arenâ€™t talking to the right people.Look at it like a funnel. Scan the app for those that fit your criteria, letâ€™s take an investor as an example. Filter down to who invests in your industry. Who invests in your region? Who invests at your ticket size? If you are seeking a seed round and have found globally renowned VC fund in the app who only invests in Series C or later, thatâ€™s going to be a short conversation.Have they invested in companies prior to you that indicate they know the industry well? Arm yourself with this information rather than spamming any VC you find. Youâ€™re far more likely to get a worthwhile response if are able to say â€œHi X, I understand you invest in our industry. This is what we are doing thatâ€™s unique, free to chat?â€And the best part? You donâ€™t even have to wait till the event. In the weeks leading up to Collision, the app will become a hive of activity as people look to get schedules in place to maximise the value of coming to an event like ours.Your exhibition day is a really wonderful resource at Collision, use it wisely! My first bit of advice here, get a look at their accreditation early. Weâ€™ve spent a lot of time on getting our accreditation right (maybe too much time!) But what it means is that all it takes is a quick glance to capture someoneâ€™s name, their company and what type of attendee they are. That may require you to change how you pitch your product. Are they media? Whatâ€™s quirky or novel about what you do that may get their attention? Do you recognise their company? How can your solution help them, or perhaps how can they help you?The great thing about your exhibition day is that anyone who stops to engage has chosen to talk with you. Something about your team or your idea has caught their eye, donâ€™t be afraid to ask what it is.And remember, itâ€™s going to be a busy day. For anyone you speak with, make sure to scan their accreditation using your app (with their permission of course!) to save their details and connect at a later date. Donâ€™t stress yourself remembering names and contacts, enjoy the conversation, scan and itâ€™s all waiting for you after the event.Probably the one time when I would advise to not prepare too much. People hit Night Summit to have fun and decompress after a long day. And you should too!For anyone you get chatting to, keep it light. Remember, they are there to let their hair down. Once again, scan their accreditation and always try and pencil in a follow up the next day of the conference (though not in the morning as there will be some groggy heads, no doubt).Youâ€™ll find a host of industry or interest-related gatherings being run each night youâ€™re in town. Find the ones that suit your aims and attend. Itâ€™s a really useful way to focus on a particular sub-section of the event. Perhaps youâ€™re hiring engineers. What better group to chat with than our Open Source initiative attendees.Our exhibiting startups are often in demand with our attending investors. We try to connect as many relevant startups and investors through our Investor Meetings facility. Here, investor attendees have the option to select startups of interest for face to face meetings. If you are selected, itâ€™s a terrific way to pitch your company away from the hustle and bustle of the exhibition floor.Yes the investor is interested, but the purpose here is not to walk away with a term sheet. Itâ€™s to pique their interest further, dampen any concerns, spark optimism and secure contact or a meeting after the event. You have fifteen minutes to make an impression. But that doesnâ€™t mean fifteen minutes to pitch. Leave plenty of time for questions, at least half of the meeting or more should be focused on questions, both from you and the investor. Signal youâ€™ve done your own research prior. Do they invest in your industry? Mention it. Is their ticket size a little bigger or smaller than what you are looking for? Ask what made them want to speak with you.And as always, scan them!â€”Make the most of your pitching opportunities at Collision and your calendar will reap the reward for months. I look forward to welcoming you to Toronto with the team here and please come and say hi!----Weâ€™re a company that holds events across the world: Web Summit in Lisbon, Web Summit Rio in Rio de Janeiro, Collision in Toronto, & RISE in Hong Kong.Web Summit--6Web Summit--21Web Summit--4Web Summit--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--121Scott H.

Where it started showing up in peopleâ€™s RSS feeds.But the story had barely gotten off the ground when the denials started to come in, both from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and from Cleevely himself.For those of you outside of Britain it perhaps hard to understand how the Raspberry Pi is viewed here in the country, as a â€œremarkableâ€ and somewhat rare British success story in a market thatâ€™s dominated by American and Asian firms.By the end of last year there had been 23 million Raspberry Pi boards sold, making the Raspberry Pi the best selling computer of all time, and the majority of those board were made here, in the United Kingdom, in Pencoed, South Wales.Eben Upton, founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, had this to say:â€œRaspberry Pi has been manufacturing a proportion of its products in the UK since 2012. Over time, that proportion has steadily increased; Raspberry Pi 3B+ is our first product manufactured solely in the UK. Weâ€™ve always said that we donâ€™t do this because weâ€™re nice guys, but because the UK is the best place in the world to build our sort of product, from the point of view of quality and cost. Tariffs on our products are extremely low, and technical standardisation happens on a global basis (the things you do to get your CE mark are broadly the same things you do to get your FCC ID), so we donâ€™t expect that any outcome to the Brexit process will undermine the case for building in the UK.â€Amongst the ongoing controversy surrounding the United Kingdomâ€™s vote to leave the European Union, and the threat that a â€˜no dealâ€™ exit could lead to large scale job losses with perhaps as many as one in five manufacturing jobs at risk, the idea that this particular British success story might be amongst those leaving was starting the generate a lot of discussion. So itâ€™s good to know that the Raspberry Pi will be staying in Britain, no matter what the outcome of the current mess.----2Scientist, Author, Hacker, Maker, and Journalist.Alasdair Allan--9Alasdair Allan--9Alasdair Allan--13Alasdair Allan--2The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Clive Thompson--19Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Scott H.

This is motivated by the main jargon of â€œPrivacy Without Compromiseâ€ or â€œPrivacy without Compromiseâ€ which can be immediately seen when opening the website. This jargon has opened up little information about the mission brought by Veil through its creation. â€œPrivacyâ€ is the main keyword that clearly states that this platform is a supporter of privacy systems on a hard line digital cryptocurrency platform. They are not arbitrary in determining the core concepts that will be determined as the main characters that will forever be embedded in them. With no compromise, privacy must always be at the forefront.Although no one thinks that this platform has a bright prospect in the world of digital currency trading, Veil does not focus on how others perceive that advantage. This is just a form of personal opinion that each individual has their own type. Nor do they determine and force the judgment because in the end, achievements will prove. At present, Veil is exploring the stage of introducing its platform to the entire community. It is not just a persuasive approach to those who are already adept at controlling the digital economy wheel, but also directly intervening in facing a large community of people who are the new target of this market.One of the efforts is to expand the collaboration with various parties which will become an extension of Veilâ€™s hand to the community because they will directly face the community anime. Recently, precisely on April 29, 2019, Veilâ€™s Twitter account officially announced that the platform has collaborated with Messari, a cryptocurrency-related information service and data company. Mesarri has included a review article about Veil on his website at messari.io. This company provides actual and reliable information about cryptocurrency platforms with the support of research data and in-depth analysis that it does. Mesarri will be a good link between the Veil platform and the community through publishing reviews and ratings to Veil. With the support of official and legal data, Messari can be used as a mainstay reference in analyzing a cryptocurrency.The latest press release by Veil on April 27, 2019 informs that the technology system in its digital wallet is currently in the latest version v1.0.3.0. This update is done to anticipate network security that will not receive further impacts on the vulnerability of Zerocoin. Zerocoin technology is reportedly experiencing a few problems that affect the effectiveness of its performance. Because he is the main person in charge of managing privacy, this vulnerability will certainly have an impact on the security system in it, especially information privacy.This was stated directly by the Zcoin platform which was the first creator of Zerocoin on its official website. It is said that Zerocoin underwent a change in operation which changed the direction of expenditure from the 100 ZXC denomination, the Zcoin digital currency. As an initial effort, Zcoin then deactivated Zerocoin spending during the investigation of the problem. This platform also recommends the temporary deactivation of the PIXV, Veil and Gravity Coin platforms as the most reasonable solution. Finally, the aftermath of the problem has been found which is caused by the failure of the Zerocoin protocol cryptography which affects the system as a whole.Updates to digital wallets by Veil are temporary. That is, the network will be protected to avoid further impact on the vulnerability shown by Zerocoin but requires them to make tough decisions to eliminate the anonymity feature of Zerocoin. The fixed wallet will facilitate users to make shipments, receive funds, and risk Veil coins. RingCT and CT coins also will not receive any significant impact after the update of this wallet. This will only temporarily reduce the functionality of Zerocoin technology on this platform. The Veil team will continue to strive for the best to immediately restore the Zerocoin privacy system to its network. So, this platform will again maintain its main character builder as a privacy platform.A privacy system will provide greater benefits than transparency, which is currently strongly maintained by most cryptocurrency platforms. By applying privacy, this does not become a barrier that will reduce user trust. With this privacy, users will slowly move from understanding the belief in transparency to privacy.Website: https://veil-project.comWallet: https://veil-project.com/get-started Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/projectveil/Twitter: https://twitter.com/projectveilReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/veilTelegram: https://t.me/VEILProjectDiscord: https://discordapp.com/invite/Ywyb9hsâ€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€” â€”----Iman muda--Iman muda--Iman muda--Iman muda--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

307,11514,https://medium.com/basis-set-ventures/a-closer-look-at-automation-in-manufacturing-8d4b9547ed7b?source=tag_archive---------93-----------------------,A Closer Look at Automation in Manufacturing,None,Basis Set Ventures,https://medium.com/@bsv,4,295,"4, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*WKZpjJqZC8_qsGnt.jpeg","Basis Set VenturesFollowBasis Set Ventures--ListenShareFor all the talk about how â€œbehindâ€ industries like manufacturing are and how destined we are to see radical changes in employment with the proliferation of AI, few in tech realize that manufacturing is one of the most automated parts of the economy.That doesnâ€™t mean it doesnâ€™t need new tech, but it does mean white space is more elusive than we credit. Understanding historical decision-making and incentive structures matters.First off â€” automation is expensive. While machines are everywhere in manufacturing, a single manufacturing cell like the one above at an automotive parts supplier can costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. And on a floor, this would commonly be one of many different set-ups. In many cases this means factories have taken on large amounts of debt in the name of automation.Cost cutting for efficiency (as most in tech like to think about it) can be an incentive to automate, but itâ€™s more often an investment in the future to remain competitive. Cost cutting is most prioritized when people feel they can no longer win contracts because they canâ€™t produce at competitive prices. For a family business, automation as a cost cutting mechanism is not growth, itâ€™s a sign of hard times.There are other incentives to automate, such as increasing complexity of parts or products that canâ€™t be produced with existing machines or the importance of combatting commoditization by adding additional value into a commodity good (think painting a steel beam or assembling a rebar cage). And taken together, these incentives have driven billions of dollars in automation investment over the last century, making companies more competitive than ever before.At the same time, theyâ€™re suffering under the weight of aging machines and often burdensome debt. Hereâ€™s a decades-old press brake from the Cincinnati Milling Machine Co. Good luck finding replacement parts or finding someone experienced to repair it. Companies often mill their own custom replacement parts, since one machine going down can halt production for an entire factory.Many of us are not used to debt-heavy, high CapEx, high fixed cost, highly cyclical, rapidly commoditizing businesses. Theyâ€™re extremely hard to run and, in the aftermath of the recession, owners have had to get extremely creative to keep their businesses afloat. This steel mill moved employees to a variable comp structure, with bonuses tied to steel demand, letting them maintain profitability remains even if utilization were to tank.Banks have proven themselves unreliable and untrustworthy partners over the last decade. Instead, use of community and regional banks is common. Some companies are even loaning themselves money and setting aside pools of cash for investment and rainy days.And then, thereâ€™s the labor challenge. Traditional automation has focused on high volume, low variance tasks. But low volume, high variance tasks are the key manufacturing tasks likely to be impacted by the proliferation of computer vision-enabled robots and AI more broadly.Today, high skill workers hold these jobs (i.e. welding). These workers are scarce and can earn nearly 6-figure salaries. With 3% unemployment rates, the recruiting scene for manufacturing companies isnâ€™t unlike San Francisco. Workers want to feel like theyâ€™re contributing to a problem that will have a big impact. They want benefits. They want culture fit. They want to be listened to and valued as more than cogs. Sound familiar?Check out this Facebook group called â€œWeldPornâ€ that has 600,000+ folks posting & engaging around DIY welds. This isnâ€™t happening in spite of automation, itâ€™s a reaction to automation. Thereâ€™s great pride in being able to do something other humans & machines alike cannot do.At BSV, weâ€™ve been lucky to meet great companies that are focused on factory floor automation â€” and we love them. But weâ€™d like to see even more companies that focus on the range of these core problems, including:If thatâ€™s your company, drop us a line.Authored by John Mannes, investor at Basis Set Ventures----Basis Set VenturesWe invest in companies that harness the opportunities for artificial intelligence (AI) to improve our work livesBasis Set Ventures--1Chang XuinBasis Set Ventures--Chang XuinBasis Set Ventures--3Basis Set Ventures--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Josep FerrerinGeek Culture--72Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Through this he found out how to create metallic types, oil-based inks, and new ways of casting type into hand molds.Johannes Gutenbergâ€™s Printing Press had a massive cultural impact. A short list of effects includes:The machine-made book restructured our brains toward the â€œanalytic management of knowledgeâ€ through the four innovations: pagination, cross referencing, punctuation, and table of contents.People tend to overestimate the short-term impact of technologies and underestimate its long-term implications. Thatâ€™s why it helps to take a long view of history.In John Naughtonâ€™s book What You Really Need To Know About The Internet: From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg, he takes such a long-view. He also makes it digestible and relevant.He helps us get a handle on what the internet is, how it came to be, and what its role is in the grand media ecosystem. So without further ado.Surprises are built into the open architecture of the Internet.The developers of the Internet in the early 1970s had two rules:1. No Central Command2. No particular app will be optimized (End-To-End Principle)The first removed the tendency for hierarchical systems to cut-off innovation when it disrupts their main power base or profit source.As Naughton writes:â€œIf you allow central control of a network then innovation will proceed at the speed deemed suitable by the controller, rather than by the inventiveness of outsiders.â€The second meant that the system was only concerned with moving data from one point to the other. It was morally agnostic about what type of content was moved â€” porn, email, and Mozart are all handled the same way.Naughton categorizes the inevitable surprises in two: â€œFirst Order Surprisesâ€ spring from the Internetâ€™s open architecture and include the Web, Napster file-sharing, Malware; â€œSecond Order Surprisesâ€ build upon the first order and include Wikipedia and Facebook.As we can already see, the Internet is different than the Web.Many lay-folk assume that the World Wide Web is the same thing as the Internet. Itâ€™s a flawed assumption: The Web is not the Internet.The World Wide Web is an application that runs on the Internetâ€™s infrastructure.Computer scientists develop the Internet, or â€œinter-networkingâ€ system, in the 1970s. Itâ€™s a way to transfer information between distant mainframe computers attached to the same network.Its open architecture is what led to the First Order Surprise that is the Web.Tim Berners-Lee developed the World Wide Web in the early 1990s. It was to expand the types of data-packets that could be transferred to distant computers on the same network.He did this by:1. Giving each web page a unique identifier (URI) and machine-readable address (URL)2. Creating a protocol that allows web clients and servers to request and serve documents (HTTP)3. Creating client-software that allowed people to browse and edit web pages (Firefox, Safari etc.) and server programs to serve up those pages on demand4. Create a standard language for editing pages that could be read by all browsers (HTML).Thatâ€™s pretty impressive for a guy fiddling around in his free time without much institutional support. Just like Gutenberg, Berners-Lee couldnâ€™t have known the long-term impacts of what he unleashed.A simple model for understanding the Web sees it as a progression from a web-of-documents to a web-of-linked-data. This involves three stages:To better analyze the Internet, Naughton suggests that we use an ecological rather than an economic framework.The economic framework was useful in an industrialized information economy of printed books and broadcast (one-to-many) media. In that model, markets were primary.The ecological framework is useful in a networked-information economy with decentralized individual action. In this model, non-market collaboration takes precedence.This models sees the Internet and its media ecosystem as a single functioning unit that experiences systemic change. It understands three vital things:1. Keystone species are vital2. Diversity of species is necessary to fill diverse niches3. Coevolution between migrating species will occur in order to adapt to new nichesAll these keystone species, diverse niches, and co-evolutionary movements are the result of copying. This holds true in the biological world as well as the cultural world. Copying is essential to human creativity.Everyone from Handel to Bach to Enlightenment thinkers borrowed, stole, reworked and innovated on the ideas of others. Despite this, copyright issues are essential.Naughton asks, â€œhow do we properly compensate creatives while not hampering the evolution of culture at the same time?â€The job of storing information is becoming less tethered to mainframe computers and more woven into the network of Cloud Computing.Large companies like Amazon and Apple own server farms that rent out computing power and storage to others on a pay-per-use or free basis.The former is easy to understand, but the latter â€œfreeâ€ is only free because one agrees to surrender some privacy in the form of personal information. Or they create user-generated content that is collected into huge data-sets sold to advertisers.This is called â€œdigital sharecroppingâ€ by Nicholas Carr, who is quite skeptical of it. More computing power, but less privacy.Lack of privacy was essential to George Orwellâ€™s dystopian vision in 1984. The totalitarian government controlled through mass surveillance operating upon things we fear.This narrative is often contrasted to Aldous Huxley vision in Brave New World. In that story, cheap entertainment and powerful drugs control the masses.The things we love, love to control us.Despite billions of web pages and endless streams of user-generated content, the majority of internet traffic goes through a few major companies.As Naughton writes:â€œThis represents an extraordinary concentration of attention on the part of a huge global audience. We use the services of these companies with gleeful abandon and forget that, in the process, they are learning a great deal about us. One day we may come to realize the truth of the old adage: in an information age, knowledge is power.â€Most likely weâ€™ll see a mixture of Orwell and Huxley as we move toward the future. Hopefully the â€œgenerativityâ€ of the internet, built upon its open architecture and programmable PCâ€™s, can break the stranglehold of New Moguls before they decide to shut it down.----Intellectual wanderlust from a nomadic book fiend.

309,25633,https://medium.com/move-forward-blog/the-future-of-autonomous-vehicles-9100d1767a05?source=tag_archive---------138-----------------------,The Future of Autonomous Vehicles,Please note that this article expresses the opinions of the author and does not reflect the views of Move Forward.,Move Forward,https://medium.com/@Move_Forward,7,0,"3, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*k6SRNqe0LcIhUZXpxedcXg.png","Move ForwardFollowMove Forward Blog--ListenShareWritten by Zach BabbThis article was originally published on June 21, 2017In the first of two recent articles discussing the emergent autonomous vehicle market, From Auto Sales to Mobility Miles, attempts to nail down how large of an autonomous fleet various car companies will need to amass in order to complement their existing business. The second, Carmageddon is Coming, paints an aggressive picture of the impending upending of transportation as we know it. Upon careful review, between both articles there are the following assumptions:â€“ That the shared vehicle economy will be competitively priced against carownership.â€“ That the adoption of electric and autonomous vehicles will be rapid likesmartphone adoption.â€“ That autonomous vehicles will be much safer than human drivers.These assumptions are naive, at best, and paint an unrealistic picture of our autonomous future. Make no mistake â€” autonomous vehicles will be disruptive and will enable things that were previously considered impossible. But if you think that humans will wake up one day and come to the conclusion that sharing and trusting a robot is better than owning and trusting yourself, youâ€™re mistaken. Letâ€™s take a look at the arguments made: economic, social, and safety.Industry projectors seem to be settling on a target of $1.25/mile driven in revenue for shared autonomous vehicles. The idea behind this number is to take the total amount taken in (revenue), from fees, fares, etc., and divide by the total miles driven. They combine this with Uber and Lyftâ€™s 85% utilization rate, where utilization is the percentage of time that a vehicle is operating and collecting fees (in other words utilization is what percent of your total driving time are you making money), to imply that sharing will generate sufficient revenue for car manufacturers at 1â€“2% of total global miles driven. As $1.25/mi is around the estimate for car ownership ($0.90/mi), they feel this is a reasonable adoption rate. All of these numbers are wrong.To begin, $1.25/mi is revenue â€” not the price people are paying. Even at 85% utilization, this implies a cost to the consumer of $1.47/mi. 85% utilization is wrong, too. It stems from Uber and Lyftâ€™s metrics, but Uber and Lyft have human drivers who will stop driving once business becomes too slow. A fleet of autonomous cars operating all day will only find 85% utilization if they are small enough to meet 85% of demand during off-peak hours, however, you then cannot capture business during peak hours. Now, you have a maxi/min problem with the amount of cars you need to capitalize on business during peak, while maintaining a low-enough off-peak utilization. Some of this can be addressed with peak pricing, essentially increasing price during periods of high demand, but thereâ€™s always a floor and the reality is that humans just donâ€™t drive enough outside of rush hours to make up for those down periods. Public transportation has been trying to solve this problem for ages, and the only way to do it is to subsidize transit. Iâ€™m doubtful that robot cars will fare better.Human beings drive an astonishing 19.5 trillion miles every year. This is enough to drive to the sun and back around 100,000 times. The numbers in the mobility miles article add up to 1.1 trillion miles across eight leading car manufacturers. This amounts to about 60% of all driving done in the United States every year. Evenly spread across all of humanity, it seems highly unlikely that any company will get to 1%, let alone many in the same amount of time. It certainly will not happen if the cost per mile to the consumer ($1.47/mi) is 60% higher than the cost of alternatives ($0.90/mi).Itâ€™s even worse than that for mobility miles, because included in that $0.90/mi is depreciation and financing. Once you own your car outright, the cost per mile becomes $0.56/mi. Why would anyone choose to spend three times as much getting around in a car they donâ€™t own than they do now? Thatâ€™s like saying people are going to stop buying houses and all live in hotels because the maid service is free.Beyond the economics, letâ€™s talk about the social aspect of transitioning towards both electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. The incredibly rapid adoption of smartphones has skewed our perception of how technologies are adopted. Smartphones were able to capitalize on the mobile phone market, which turned over every two years due to the structure of phone contracts. Cars donâ€™t turnover like that. A much better analog to the world of vehicles is the TV market. Innovation in TV happens and people adopt it, but itâ€™s rare to see anything that causes a large shift. Itâ€™s very likely the last TV you purchased is a flat screen, itâ€™s also very likely that that had little to do with your decision-making process. So, too, with EVs and AVs from a purchasing standpoint. If youâ€™re in the market for a new car, you may explore those technologies, but itâ€™s doubtful that you will rush out to upgrade. Itâ€™s simply too large of a purchase. My 2000 Camry still runs just fine and is paid off. The transition from ICEs to EVs and to AVs will happen inline with the market upgrade cycle for cars, and that cycle is slow and plodding.Steve Jobs had some choice words on the second part of the TV subject. This is the bigger part of entrants into the autonomous vehicle market: fragmentation of the driving ecosystem. Itâ€™s one thing to put sensors on a car for forward warning of collisions; itâ€™s quite another to make a system that can navigate a large east coast city built 200 years ago when people still rode horses. How do you deal with this as a car company? Do you make the Washington D.C. version of a car? Do you put a cap on its generalization (say, stay out of complex downtown areas)? And, ultimately, how do you do this in a way that provides drivers with greater utility than their own decision-making? At moovel, we have spent years toiling to digitalize the myriad fare systems for public transportation that our apps are in. Extending that to the plethora of arcane rules around driving will be no easy task.Which brings us to safety. Iâ€™ll concede that early data seems promising, and to the extent that sensors and early warning help keep us all safe I am all for them. Before we go too far, though, I would like everyone to read the story of the Therac-25. While I am worried about drunk drivers, in an autonomous world I would be much more worried about the developer on a rushed deadline who pushes lousy code and accidentally kills thousands. You see, when human beings fail, we do so in isolation â€” but when machines fail, they do so at scale and that scares the hell out of me.I donâ€™t worry much about my car breaking down, because it was engineered by certified professionals working with the benefit of the learnings of the last 100 years of mechanical engineering. One canâ€™t even be called a mechanical engineer without a rigorous certification process. Software is much less mature, and while the fact that anyone can buy a book on programming and go on to invent the next great app is one of the beauties of the industry, it doesnâ€™t translate all that well to the rigorous attention to detail necessary when human safety is at stake. Let me assure you that I will never work on your robot car, because I donâ€™t trust myself enough to entrust your safety to me.Iâ€™d be much less concerned if the people promising our autonomous future seemed to realize the gravity of that responsibility, but, unfortunately, they donâ€™t. The risky movements of Travis Kalanick and his ilk may be good at garnering funds from VCs, but itâ€™s hardly the personality you want from someone who wants to build robot cars to drive your kids to soccer. Every time one of these mavericks starts promising a world devoid of human suffering from automobile accidents, all I can see is some M. Night Shyamalan-nightmare, where half the cars in the world start accidentally driving into buildings because a developer forgot that Arizona doesnâ€™t follow daylight savings time.I am bullish on the possibilities of automation, but I urge all of us to be cautious of grandiose claims. All itâ€™ll take is a Tesla plowing through your block party because it didnâ€™t recognize the rope your neighbor put up as a barrier for us to slow down and make sure we approach the question of safety appropriately. The FDA takes years to approve drugs; I donâ€™t see any reason why we shouldnâ€™t be equally cautious about autonomous driving. Traffic accidents are the leading non-biological cause of death, and Iâ€™m not sure thatâ€™s the right place to launch our autonomous future. Perhaps we should start with robots that make breakfast.The future of electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles is upon us. They will open up new possibilities, revenue streams, and will create new efficiencies for us. If everyone involved can make a future where transportation is cheaper, safer, and ubiquitous, I am 100% in. At its core, thatâ€™s the promise of public transportation, and itâ€™s why I enjoy working in this space. And, no matter what happens to cars, there will still be buses and trains, and weâ€™ll help you get on board.â€”----Move Forward BlogDiscussing the future of urban mobility and smart cities.Move ForwardinMove Forward Blog--Move ForwardinMove Forward Blog--Move ForwardinMove Forward Blog--Move ForwardinMove Forward Blog--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Alex Mathers--220HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Still, new solutions related to order automation, assortment management and customer service keep emerging. One of such improvements is the implementation of chatbots, both in terms of customer and sales support.Chatbots are applications implemented into instant messengers to replace humans in basic customer communication. We can call them automated customer service staff members, solving the most common problems users need to deal with. A significant advantage of chatbots is that you donâ€™t have to install any additional applications. Bots have already been installed in apps users have in their smartphones and use every day.Year after year, the popularity of chatbots have been growing. They play an increasing role in many areas of business, so there is no surprise that they are continually being developed based on AI and machine learning. At the F8 conference in May 2018, it was reported that developers created over 300,000 bots for Facebook Messenger, which is 100,000 more than a year ago. And these are only data related to Facebook Messenger. Bots are also developed for WeChat, Kik or Slack.Instant messenger bots are divided into information and tool bots. Information bots are designed to inform the user about promotions, delays in their order processing or new articles on a companyâ€™s website. In contrast, tool bots, e.g. sales bots, are designed to trigger a specific action or solve usersâ€™ problem. They can advise the user which mountain and hiking jacket to buy and help close the transaction that has been started in an instant messenger. Based on the options selected by the user, the collected data can be used to create ads or for subsequent purchases.An example of a tool chatbot is the one used by Avon Poland, helping users select a perfume matching their personality. The bot takes the user through a series of questions, from gender to the ways they spend their free time and clothes they like to wear.Benefits of implementing a chatbot in your online storeChatbots in e-commerce improve not only customer service operations but also the work of the marketing department, so they have an impact on sales. The main benefits of implementing a chatbot in an online store are the following:It is hard to ignore the benefits of implementing a chatbot, primarily because of the current technology development, it is not difficult to build one. There are, however, challenges: the communication strategy implemented into the bot and refraining from creating a multifunctional program. The best practice is to perfect the bot in a selected field and only then work on its capabilities. In this way, it will provide users with the best possible experience, which may encourage them to use it again. They will also be more willing to accept the botâ€™s minor errors and imperfections.Possible ways of using chatbots in e-commerce:â€“ assistance in selecting products and making purchase decisionsâ€“ closing transactionsâ€“ checking the order statusâ€“ processing returns and complaintsâ€“ booking servicesâ€“ answering frequently asked questionsâ€“ informing consumers about promotions and new arrivalsâ€“ presenting new collectionsâ€“ finding the nearest brick-and-mortar shopâ€“ keeping in touch with customers after the purchaseâ€“ supporting loyalty programsWhat customersâ€™ attitude towards chatbotsApart from optimizing business processes in e-commerce, chatbots also bring many benefits to customers, such as quick and efficient information on the status of their order, processing complaints or improving next purchases thanks to the fact they remember usersâ€™ preferences and the details of the previously selected products.Put simply, chatbots are comfortable. The user does not have to leave the application they use to contact their family or friends, which is particularly important when considering changes taking place in e-commerce, particularly the growing dominance of mobile solutions over desktop ones.A survey conducted in the USA in early 2019 by Uberall, Inc. can be proof that customers appreciate the benefits of implementing chatbots as one of the channels they use to communicate with brands. According to the research, 40% of its participants would like to have an opportunity to interact with brand chatbots, and about 80% have some positive experience connected with chatbots. When asked what could increase their satisfaction with talking to bots, 43% indicated that bots need to understand better customer queries and they have to use more a natural language (19%). However, some of the survey participants (27%) would like to be able to get in touch with a human if a bot cannot solve their problem. Whatâ€™s interesting, it wasnâ€™t customer service they mentioned as the main purpose chatbots should be used. More than a third of the survey participants said they would like chatbots to offer them promotions and coupons. Customer service came second, and the fewest respondents were interested in providing product recommendations or the ability to shop in the chat application.The Userlike team conducted another research. Their aim was to find out whether respondents have ever used chatbots, what their experience with chatbots was, and what advantages and disadvantages related to chatbots they could see. It turned out that 99% of the survey participants had used chatbots before and, in most cases, they could share a positive experience.Whatâ€™s more, respondents would rather talk to a chatbot than to a customer service representative if it let them save some time. At the same time, they would like to be able to easily and quickly change the bot to a staff member. It is understandable, mainly since the chatbots can only be used for simple requests regarding products or orders. Even though chatbots are considered innovative (just like companies that implemented them), the trust they can enjoy is still low â€” only 36% of the respondents would make a payment via a bot.Similar conclusions were presented in the report prepared by Drift, Audience, Salesforce, and myclever. The report shows that customers like to use chatbots to get answers to simple questions quickly. As for the most significant benefits from communicating with chatbots, they mentioned a possibility to get round-the-clock service (64%) and, as mentioned above, to receive instant answers to inquiries (55%) or simple questions (55%).These results clearly show that consumers think of chatbots as tools that save time and improve their communication with brands.The authors of the report are aware of the fact that, apart from listing the benefits, itâ€™s good to ask consumers what prevents them from using this technology. The main barriers mentioned by the respondents were the following:Whatâ€™s interesting, 15% of the study participants said they didnâ€™t see any potential barriers that would discourage them from using chatbots.As for the expected response time, chatbots came second (75%). Users expected a quicker response from an online chat supported by a staff member (77%). The difference between the two channels is insignificant and equals only two percentage points. We can, therefore, assume that combining these channels can increase customer satisfaction and improve query processing. Employees can help customers during business hours, and outside business hours or when all consultants are busy, chatbots can support customer service.The research presented here is very optimistic when it comes to the use of chatbots in customer communication as well as the automation of specific company processes. There still is a large group of consumers who do not want to use chatbots or even donâ€™t trust this technology. However, it should not discourage e-commerce businesses from implementing chatbots, mainly due to the fact that consumers look for communication channels that will provide them with a quick answer to their questions.What you have to remember about when implementing a chatbotWhen implementing a chatbot, whether in a messenger or in an online store, you should always remember a bot is not a human. It will not answer every question, and its learning capabilities are still limited. Machine learning requires a massive amount of data and thus, plenty of time. That is why people are still necessary. Besides, not every customer understands how chatbots work. Some of them want to talk to a human immediately, and they should be able to do so in a relatively short time. That is why an efficient signal system should be implemented to let customer service staff know a consumer needs their assistance and that they should take over from their bot.You should also remember that bots are only programs that can break down. You need to monitor their operation and react quickly if necessary. Bots donâ€™t understand all words, especially if they contain typos or spelling errors. They also have difficulty in understanding the context of a situation and arenâ€™t able to combine several statements into a coherent whole. They are also unable to cope with situations where a sentence is sent as a set of single words, each in a separate message. A bot will not combine such messages into a whole and will not understand the statement. What is more, bots donâ€™t read between the lines and donâ€™t understand sarcasm or slang. That is why, to operate effectively, they need an interlocutor who is aware of their limitations.The challenge for marketers is to design conversation scenarios in such a way that both parties, the brand and the user, can benefit from using bots in communication. That is why Hubspot has prepared the so-called Inbound Messaging Framework that lets you quickly build conversation templates in chatbots.The Inbound Messaging Framework, which we can translate as an incoming message model, consists of 4 steps. The first one is to choose the messenger our target group uses. In this step, we also determine the language of communication and its form, e.g. colloquial, friendly or formal. The second step is to understand the userâ€™s needs and intentions at the start of the conversation. To learn it, we should encourage them to answer a series of basic, interdependent questions. For instance, if our bot is to support the customer service of an online footwear store, we should start by asking the user if they are interested in womenâ€™s or menâ€™s shoes. In the third step, we optimize the conversation in such a way as to provide the user with the best possible experience when interacting with the bot. The last step is to use the acquired data thoughtfully so that we can solve future user inquiries even faster and satisfy their needs.It is crucial to decide what the aim of every chatbot you create is. What value should it give to the user and the brand? Is conversion, such as a purchase or booking a service, its primary goal? Or is it just supposed to establish a relationship with the user and entertain them? The Aerie online store chatbot has a well-defined aim (purchase). Similarly to every other e-commerce business, at Aerie, itâ€™s the sales that matter at the end of the day. That is why the user can get help in choosing underwear and then quickly make a purchase without closing the messenger window.A popular e-commerce chatbot that has good customer reviews is the one used by Sephora, perfectly matching the brandâ€™s target group. The botâ€™s language is consistent with the brandâ€™s messages in all the other channels. The suggested help topics are among the most frequently chosen by customers and, what is important, from the very beginning the customer can talk to a staff member if they donâ€™t want to use automatic suggestions. Elements of AR â€” augmented reality â€” can also be found here. AR allows you, e.g. to check how different colours of makeup cosmetics will look on your face. Just choose a makeup suggestion and direct your phone camera towards your face as if you were taking a selfie.Remember, however, that it isnâ€™t enough to implement a chatbot to be successful and achieve your goals. If users are supposed to use your chatbot, you must tell them that they can and explain why the bot can help or advise them quickly and efficiently. In other words, it is necessary to promote the chatbot among current and potential customers. Below, you will find a few useful ideas on how to do it:Are there any consAlthough participants of the surveys mentioned above had a positive attitude towards chatbots, it is still a new technology, and customers might not trust it yet. They are often worried about the information and data they provide, as well as about the security of their transactions. Therefore, donâ€™t ask your customers about their personal data -their name and surname or phone number â€” too early in the conversation. Thatâ€™s what, e.g. the agromallcom.ng bot does. In this way, you can lose a prospect who doesnâ€™t know your brand yet, and they donâ€™t trust it.There is also a risk that users may soon get bored with the technology or even fear that bots will stand in their way as they are present in applications used to talk with family and friends. Too many open chatbot windows will make it difficult to find important private conversations. In the worst-case scenario, users can block your bot, and if they do so, you can get punished by the messenger owners who want people to spend as much time as possible using their tool.What is more, we can also destroy chatbotsâ€™ potential if we use them to inundate users with marketing content and, in this way, discourage them from using this communication channel. Thatâ€™s what happened to e-mail marketing, which, instead of being used to maintain relationships with customer, became a channel used to bombard subscribers with â€œuniqueâ€ occasions and â€œsuperâ€ promotions. That is why whatâ€™s extremely important is moderation and a well-thought-out strategy when it comes to using chatbots â€” not only in customer service but also in marketing.It is no secret that customers expect their problems should be solved quickly and in a simple way. They also want to find the information they are looking for. Chatbots have a lot to offer in this respect, including boosting customer online experience. However, they cannot totally replace humans. Itâ€™s good to use their potential in 24-hour customer service, to provide immediate response and answer simple questions. By combining chatbots with a human-supported chat, you can offer real-time customer service, give users a sense of security and an error-free solution to their problems.This article was originally published here.

This year, we got three new ones. iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. They all look good and everything. But are they really worth the upgrade? Well, if you are coming from an iPhone 7 or 8, then you can consider the upgrade. Otherwise, we suggest you wait it out till the 2020 batch comes out as they are expected to be a drastic upgrade to the current range.iPhone 11 is a direct upgrade to the iPhone XR, iPhone 11 Pro to the iPhone XS, and iPhone 11 Pro Max to the iPhone XS Max. They all get the new A13 Bionic chipset, which is undoubtedly the fastest chip in the market. Not like anyone was catching up to the A12, anyway, but an upgrade is always appreciated. One more thing that is all the rage and for good reason, the cameras. The cameras on all three phones are updated and they seem to be the real deal.The iPhone 11 has two cameras on the back. Whereas the other two models have a triple camera setup. All three phones have a dual camera setup for all your selfie needs. Letâ€™s talk about the iPhone 11, first.Rear Camera: 12 MP, f/1.8, 26mm (wide), 1/2.55"", 1.4Âµm, PDAF, OIS & a 12 MP, f/2.4, 13mm (ultrawide)Front Camera: 12 MP, f/2.2 & a TOF 3D cameraThe iPhone XR had only one camera on the back and front, which were good enough, but the dual camera setup on iPhone 11 is just better. Well, to start with, it has an extra sensor on both sides. On the rear, you get a much awaited ultrawide sensor that people have been craving for so long. There is a new camera interface which looks more intuitive in general. It lets you see a faded wide angle view to let you know how much more area you can capture if you choose to switch to the wide angle camera. Apart from this, there is finally a Night Mode in iPhones, now. This Night Mode will trigger automatically if detects a dark environment and from all the sample we have seen till now, we can say that it works pretty well. In the front, they upgraded the old 7 MP sensor with a better and more capable 12 MP sensor. And added a Time of Flight (TOF) sensor which is used to gather more accurate depth information. This pair is also capable of capturing something they call â€˜Slofieâ€™, which is nothing but a live slow-motion selfie. The addition of the TOF sensor also means better portrait mode shots as a result of better edge detection. Something theyâ€™ve done in the software processing helps the front camera take wide-angle shots every time you rotate the camera into horizontal position. There is no ultrawide lens that you are switching to here, but the image on the viewfinder will literally push back in realtime for you to capture a much wider area. Both the front and rear cameras can capture up to 4K 60 FPS videos, which is great. One more thing, they added a feature called Quick Capture which basically lets you record a video without having to switch from photo mode to video mode. It is very much how we capture videos on social media platforms like Instagram or Snapchat.2. iPhone 11 Pro & Pro Max:Rear Camera: 12 MP, f/1.8, 26mm (wide), 1/2.55"", 1.4Âµm, PDAF, OIS,12 MP, f/2.0, 52mm (telephoto), 1/3.4"", 1.0Âµm, PDAF, OIS, 2x optical zoom &12 MP, f/2.4, 13mm (ultrawide)Front Camera: Same as iPhone 11Both the phones have exactly the same camera setup and features. Also, they are not very different from the iPhone 11. Thereâ€™s one thing different and that is the extra sensor. Both the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max have a telephoto sensor. This adds the extra 2x zoom capability which is not present on the iPhone 11. Another great thing about this triple camera setup is the stabilisation. While the primary and telephoto lenses are stabilised using OIS and EIS, the ultrawide lens has to manage with EIS only. What is also unique about these cameras is the synchronization between the three. If you choose to transition between the three cameras during a video capture, it will be seamless unlike on any other phone in the market with a multiple camera setup. Apple has managed to achieve this with the help of the raw power of A13 Bionic chip, which allows for realtime processing to work flawlessly. It also has the audio zoom, which is definitely welcome. One more feature which will not be available out of the box but will be added over an update or as an app is something very similar to what the app called FilMic Pro does. Basically, it will allow you to capture dual simultaneous videos using two different sensors on the phone. For e.g. you can record a video using your wide angle lens and the ultrawide angle lens at the same time. You can capture videos up to 4K 60 FPS from all the three sensors on the back, so thatâ€™s great. And portrait mode pictures can now be clicked using the primary (wide angle) sensor and not just the telephoto lens, if you choose to.To sum it all up, they are calling their iPhones â€˜Proâ€™ for the first time ever, for one good reason. The cameras on these iPhones are capable of doing some crazy, pro level imaging. Theyâ€™ve put together a good mixture of hardware mixed with a good amount of computational photography to make it all work like a charm. Google is yet to release the latest iteration of their flagship Pixel phone. Till now they have resisted on using more than one lens at the back, claiming that their one lens can do everything using their strong computation photography support. But can they now? We will find out when they release the Pixel 4 in less than a month from now. Till then, stay tuned to DeCode for more on all your favourite tech products.----DeCodeINDeCode StaffinDeCodeIN--1DeCode StaffinDeCodeIN--DeCode StaffinDeCodeIN--DeCode StaffinDeCodeIN--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Scott H.

And Mooreâ€™s Law expands those possibilities.Using the parameters of how something is manufactured, AlphaZero should be able to optimize, to near perfection, almost any design. It could start simply: for example, AlphaZero could optimize the way the copper wire is spun around the central rotating rod of a motor. It could do this all virtually by simulating it in a computer program.It would start out by randomly moving the arm that directs the wire as the copper is spun around the central rod. The speed of moving the directing rod, its direction, and the timing of any changes would all be randomized. Then AlphaZero would get a baseline performance for that initial random design by powering up the virtual motor with a simulator to determine its power and efficiency. From here it would repeat randomly many times, with many variations, as AlphaZero does so well. As it goes along, it incorporates the design changes that help it improve over time, automatically. I hope you can see how, in theory, this process could be scaled up to optimize any design conceivable by man, and perhaps in time devices not conceivable by man. Perhaps the hardest part of this process, since AlphaZero is already so powerful, fast, and efficient, is accurately and efficiently simulating the electric motor, with all of its electromagnetic physics interactions.Imagine AlphaZero optimizing all the parts of a car, then being given all the parts for a car (with many variants) to teach itself how to build a car. We would give AlphaZero the constraints of certain features to optimize for such as the ability to move, power, reasonable cabin shape and size, and efficiency. AlphaZero may be able to improve the car, but using this method AlphaZero may come up with a concept that does not remotely resemble a modern car. Perhaps it would come up with a legged or a winged creation, or something that forces air around itself for propulsion. Who knows?I am so excited for DeepMind to grow and for them to keep letting us know the many use cases that they dream up and implement for AlphaZero, as well as the use cases of any new AI engines that they might create.----PredictFollower of Jesus, Director of Digital Marketing at Tornado.com.

Anyone can become a validator and run a validator node on Matic chain by staking on Ethereum chain.Responsibilities of validators under Heimdall include the following:Heimdall chain makes sure that block producer nodes donâ€™t commit any sort of fraud, hence they donâ€™t trust any information they receive from Bor. Heimdall relies only on Ethereum as a source of truth, for everything ranging from incoming new validators, exiting validators, to reward distribution to validators, etc happens on the Ethereum chain. After a validator related action is performed on smart-contract, the validator can submit a validatorJoin or validatorExit or validatorUpdate transaction on Heimdall. All validators query the smart-contract that manages the validators and validates transactions on Heimdall.Here are some of the problems we have faced while designing the validator node:Maintaining sync between Ethereum and Heimdall is hard, but not impossible. In the course of development, we came up with several approaches to solve these issues. It took us many iterations on the drawing board to make this work elegantly.Here is how sending a checkpoint via Heimdall works right now:But but butâ€¦ What if a proposer doesnâ€™t submit a checkpoint? ðŸ¤”11. After a certain interval, the next validators in line send a NoAck transaction to all validators, signaling that a checkpoint hasn't been submitted to the smart contract in a long time and they want to send a checkpoint.12. Heimdall checks if this is true and allows the next proposer in line to restart the process ðŸ˜ƒThis two-phase checkpointing allows us to easily keep both the chains in sync and helps us punish proposers who did not submit checkpoint and reward good validators.We hope this post gave you an overview of how the Validator layer interacts with Ethereum.

When a program needs to use a third-party library, we can refer to this library as a dependency. But where does â€œinjectionâ€ come in?There is a saying, that to find a personâ€™s worth you need to look at his opponents. The opponent of dependency injection is dependency lookup. Dependency injection and dependency lookup are both ways to implement Inversion of Control (IoC).The main goal of Inversion of control and Dependency Injection is to remove dependencies of an application. This makes the system more decoupled and maintainable.Inversion of ControlFirst letâ€™s try to understand IOC (Inversion of control). If you go back to old computer programming days, program flow used to run in its own control. For instance letâ€™s consider a simple chat application flow as shown in the below flow diagram.Now if you analyze the program flow closely, itâ€™s sequential. The program is in control of himself. Inversion of control means the program delegates control to someone else who will drive the flow. For instance if we make the chat application event based then the flow of the program will go something as below:-If you see the program flow itâ€™s not sequential, its event based. So now the control is inverted. So rather than the internal program controlling the flow, events drive the program flow. Event flow approach is more flexible as their no direct invocation which leads to more flexibility.A word of caution here, do not conclude that IOC are implemented by only events. You can delegate the control flow by callback delegates, observer pattern, events, DI (Dependency injection) and lot of other ways.IOC (Inversion of control) is a general parent term while DI (Dependency injection) is a subset of IOC. IOC is a concept where the flow of application is inverted. So for example rather than the caller calling the method.The two methods mentioned earlier, dependency injection and dependency lookup, are methods that you can use anywhere.You may have heard of the service locator in the spring framework. Now there are many predecessors who think that Service Locator is an anti-pattern. In fact, service Locator is a concrete implementation of dependency lookup. Although the idea of service locator and dependency injection are essentially opposites, MS.DI uses the service locator when implementing the dependency injection framework.If you havenâ€™t used spring, itâ€™s okay.Let us try to clarify the relationship between the two. Obviously, Dependency Injection is mainly about injecting. There is a very interesting answer on Dependency Injection on Stack Overflow. The question is how to explain dependency injection to a five-year-old child:When a child goes and gets things out of the refrigerator by themselves, they might create problems. They might leave the door open, or might get something Mommy or Daddy doesnâ€™t want them to have. They might even be looking for something they donâ€™t even have or which has expired.What they should be doing is stating a need, â€œI need something to drink with lunch,â€ and then the parent will make sure they have something when they sit down to eat.So the right approach is to ask the children what they need, then we will find something from the refrigerator and find out and hand it to them.To make an analogy, children taking out things from the refrigerator is similar to dependency lookup; when we provide things to children as adults, this is dependency injection.Before discussing dependency injection in detail, I think we need to review the five principles of design patterns (some places mention six or even seven, but these overlap the basic five), Part 2 in this series will go through the first couple of these principlesEpisode 1: Resolving the Memory Dilemma on aelf blockchainEpisode 2: AElf Consensus Contract Standard (ACS4)Episode 3: Developerâ€™s Take on GetConsensusCommandâ€” Join the Community:Â· Get on our Telegram Discord Slack and Kakao channelÂ· Follow us on Twitter Reddit and FacebookÂ· Read weekly articles on the aelf blogÂ· Catch up with the develop progress on GithubÂ· Telegram community in í•œêµ­ ,æ—¥æœ¬èªž ,Ñ€ÑƒÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ ,Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø±Ø¨ÙŠØ© ,Deutsch ,ItalianoandTiáº¿ng Viá»‡t,Â· Instagram: aelfblockchainÂ· YouTube Channel: aelfFor more information, visit aelf.io----aelfaelf Developerinaelf--Ã¦lfinaelf--Ã¦lfinaelf--aelf Developerinaelf--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Jacob BennettinLevel Up Coding--51Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Hussein Nasser--36Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116aruva - empowering ideas--52HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

And if youâ€™re lucky enough to work in the wellness industry as I do for MINDBODY, well, youâ€™ve hit the jackpot.In todayâ€™s job market, top companies are in a tight race competing for top talent. During my six years at Glassdoor, I talked to hundreds of HR and Recruiting leaders about their challenges. What I learned is that smart employers recognize that in order to recruit the best candidates, theyâ€™ve got to create a workplace that not only offers growth and opportunity from a professional standpoint, but one that nourishes the employee as a human being in mind, body and spirit.That means creating an environment thatâ€™s diverse, inclusive, and encourages employees to bring their whole selves to work â€” ideally, their healthiest selves â€” because a healthy and happy employee is an engaged and productive one. (Also because itâ€™s the right thing to do. We should all be encouraging those around us to pursue their best lives.Here are some of the different ways the highest rated employers are helping nourish the mind, body and soul of their people:1. MIND: They encourage employees to make mental wellness a priority.At MINDBODY, we offer regular meditation and breathwork classes onsite at our corporate headquarters which remote offices can stream live. Companies can also offer free or discounted memberships to handy apps like Calm or Headspace (my personal fave) to teach employees how mindfulness exercises can increase focus and promote creativity. At some of the hippest tech startups, you might even find designated quiet rooms or even nap pods for employees to rest and recharge throughout the day.Investing in learning and development programs is another way to boost the brainpower of employees. Online courses and onsite workshops can help people sharpen their skills or learn about new career paths. And providing opportunities for employees to learn from experts in their craft by letting high performers travel to a conference or bringing guest speakers onsite promotes a culture of continuous improvement and learning while keeping your most ambitious people engaged.The best companies also find ways to allocate a certain percentage of employee time to do what they see as the fun stuff â€” i.e. get creative (marketing), build cool sh*t (engineering), or tackle the complex problems with big impact (leadership).2. BODY: They want their employees to be physically active and not fall victim to sedentary office life behind a computerHealthy and fit employees are not only happier and more productive than their less active coworkers, but they are likely to incur lower health costs for employers.At MINDBODY weâ€™re lucky enough to have an onsite gym at our HQ where we offer multiple daily classes from Crossfit to Pilates. We even set up cameras so our remote offices can live stream them!For companies who donâ€™t have an onsite space, they can subsidize gym memberships or on demand workouts. Restorative health services like massages, acupuncture, and chiropractic can be included in medical benefits or employer-subsidized. You should have seen the office buzz when our Wellness Team brought 15-minute chair massages onsite for a week!When youâ€™re behind a computer for 8â€“10 hours per day, the carpal tunnel struggle is real. Ergonomic support services (think high quality chairs, monitor risers, standing desks and wrist supports) make sure employees are physically set up at their workstations in good alignment to avoid unnecessary stress and fatigue.3. SPIRIT: They foster a workplace environment thatâ€™s diverse, inclusive, and built around human connection.Brene Brown has entered mainstream conversation thanks to her Top 5 most-watched TED Talk on vulnerability, her newest book Dare to Lead about courageous leadership, and now her own Netflix special Call to Courage.Through years of research, Brene has found that in work relationships, if we have the courage to be vulnerable and authentically connect with each other, we experience a powerful sense of belonging which drives engagement and productivity.Companies have a huge opportunity right now to show employees and potential candidates that they care enough to create supportive environments as they listen to the evolving demands of younger generations entering the workforce. Diversity and inclusion isnâ€™t just a recruiting initiative; itâ€™s a cultural value. Todayâ€™s top companies encourage employees to connect with others in communities where they identify through internal support groups, informal meetups and even online chats. At MINDBODY we have a highly engaged #MBPride Slack channel with regular LGBTQIA+ events at our different office along with a thriving Women In Tech chapter that hosts a regular panel discussion live streamed to our 14 offices around the globe.Health benefits like EAP services that include mental health support, legal services, and short term disability, maternity and paternity leave, and floating holidays that give employees the opportunity to celebrate their faith are becoming standard-issue for most mid to large companies in the US.Above all else, I think the best way companies can nourish the health and happiness of their employees is to treat them as people, and as individuals.Managers should be encouraged to get to know their people so they can stay in tune with whatâ€™s going on in their personal lives. Maybe theyâ€™re having an off week because their marriage is in trouble, or their kid got suspended from school, or they are taking care of a sick parent. Instead of pretending our employees are working 24â€“7 or putting tight restrictions on when and where they work out of fear theyâ€™re not giving 110%, maybe weâ€™d see better overall performance if we encouraged vs permitted our people to take an afternoon off to mentally reset and recharge. Or told them to fly home to work remote for a week so they could take care of a family member. Or offered to move the time of a weekly meeting so they could go to their favorite jiu jitsu class.In my experience, if you hire the right people who are intrinsically motivated, take the time to get to know them and whatâ€™s important in their lives, and try and create a working environment that actively supports and nourishes them in mind, body and spirit, youâ€™ll not only have a high performer on your hands â€” youâ€™ll have a healthier, happier human and isnâ€™t that what lifeâ€™s all about?----Marketing Exec | Keynote Speaker | Feisty Cancer WarriorAlison Hadden--Alison Hadden--Alison Hadden--Alison Hadden--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--766Alex Mathers--219Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Zulie RaneinThe Startup--402HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

CookFollow--ListenShareYears before the Internet became more than a research/military project in the US, a network called Minitel was thriving in France. This system allowed users access to email, games, chat, and other pursuits, and caught on in a large part because the government gave free terminals to every French telephone subscriber.This worked great until the late â€™90s and early 2000s, when it was replaced by the wider web, leading to dumpsters and dumpsters full of discarded terminals. This also meant â€” and means â€” that these terminals are available on the secondhand market for around $25. For those in North America, however, actually getting one here from France will cost well more than the unit itself. North American hackers will need to supply their unit 220V AC as well, though there are apparently US versions if you can find one.While basic by todayâ€™s standards, they have a very cyberpunk look and are simple enough to be a great hacking target. To this end, researchers Kevin Driscoll and Julien Mailland have been able to interface with the terminal â€” they selected a model â€œ1Bâ€ â€” using Linux and accomplish such feats as creating a Twitter client and an ASCII art webcam.After getting their hands on the Minitelâ€™s official technical specification, Driscoll and Mailland even built a videotex server using an Arduino Uno and a a logic-level converter thatâ€™s capable of displaying various screens and animations on its monochrome CRT with the help of an old 16-bit teletext authoring tool.If this sounds like a fun time, you can browse the Minitel Research Lab, USA website for more info. Theyâ€™ve also written Minitel welcome to the Internet, which gives a bit more context on how the system was developed and used.[h/t: IEEE Spectrum]----Engineer, tech writer, content creator, maker of random contraptions for fun and profit.Jeremy S.

I know it was very short notice between the announcement and the actual AMA hosted by Richie (our favorite Binance Angel). This was a very special AMA. We shared with everyone our latest plans on working with real customers with real use cases. It was supposed to last for only an hour. Sherman was glued to his laptop for over 2 and a half hours and many cups of coffee to power through. At one point, 200â€“300 questions came simultaneously. This may have been the most successful AMA ever hosted on t.me/BinanceDEXchange :) Thank you so much to the Binance Chain community for having us.Here is the full transcript. You donâ€™t want to miss a single word.INTRODUCTIONQ. Hello Mr. Sherman! How are you doing today?A. Hey Richie, I am doing well! Thank you so much for having me here today ðŸ™Q. So, before we start the show. Could you kindly tell us a bit about you and Raven Protocol?A. Yes of course. I will be glad to introduce myself and Raven.Hey Binance DEX community! I am Sherman from Raven Protocol. We are working on decentralized and distributed AI training. Our value proposition solves a very specific problem â€” the speed of AI training. It typically takes about 2â€“3 weeks to train a 1M image dataset on say AWS. Raven is building a distribution framework from the ground up that takes this down to 2â€“3 hours.The team has been working in AI and Machine Learning for years. Personally, Iâ€™ve been doing ML since 2008. Rahul has built a ML platform with enterprise customers. Kailash wrote the book on Building Next-gen Generative Models https://www.amazon.in/ Generative-Adversarial-Networks-Projects-next-generation- ebook/dp/B07F2MY1QH. Shannon worked on content generation using AI.Q. Okay. Thank you Mr. Sherman. Hope AI wonâ€™t reach to the level where they could start hosting AMAâ€™s ðŸ˜‚A. It will be a long time before AI can reach the level of sophistication as you Richie. But Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s close enough in terms of the tech today help you augment your work to make it more efficient!SEGMENT ONE: [QUESTIONS FROM THE AMA HOST]Q. Raven is working on a deep technical problem. Can you please explain more about how it works?A. Raven is creating a network of compute nodes that utilize idle compute power for the purposes of AI training where speed is the key. A native token is the key to bootstrapping a nascent network.We want to incentivize and reward people all over the world to contribute their compute power to our network. Additionally, we will reward token holders for running masternodes which will be responsible for orchestrating the training of various deep neural networks.Our consensus mechanism is something we call Proof-of-Calculation. Proof-of-Calculation will be the primary guideline for the regulation and distribution of incentives to the compute nodes in the network. Following are the two prime deciders for the incentive distribution:Speed: Depending upon how fast a node can perform gradient calculations (in a neural network) and return it back to the Gradient Collector.Redundancy: The 3 fastest redundant calculation will only qualify for receiving the incentive. This will make sure that the gradients that are getting returned are genuine and of the highest quality.Q. How do you plan to compete with big players like AWS? Now thatâ€™s a challenge I would say, but no doubts that it canâ€™t be achieved.A. Going up against big players is not as scary as it seems. They have their own set ways of doing things and they can be disrupted. Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Golem, etc., offer general cloud compute. We focus specifically on the speed of AI training. Thus, building our own distribution framework allows us to bring down the AI training time down.Conventional distribution methods have an inherent latency in their network. Large chunks of data need to be passed between machines. Our unique approach to distribution solves latency by chunking the data into really small pieces (bytes), maintaining its identity, and then distributing it across the host of devices with a call to action: gradient calculations.To dive in a bit, we take both Data and Model Parallelization approaches to form a different model of distribution.A major difference between a static and dynamic computation graph is that in the former, the model optimization is preset, and the data substitutes the placeholder tensors. Whereas, in the latter the nodes in a network are executed without a need for any placeholder tensors. The benefit of a dynamic graph is its concurrency, and it is robust enough to handle the contributor addition or deletion, making the whole Raven training sustainable.Raven is thus capable of eliminating the latency and scalability issues, with both the approaches. Hence, distributing the training of any deeper neural network and their larger datasets, by getting rid of the added dependency on the Model replication. Data is also sharded in smaller snippets.In fact, the Model is intact at the Master Node, and the heavy lifting is distributed in the tiniest snippets of data subsets over the network of contributors. The resultant gradients, after the calculations that happen at the node/contributor ends, are sent back to the Master Node.This creates a ton of difference, as it is easier for calculations to pass through from machine to machine, rather than creating multiple replicas of a complicated Model.Q. What are the latest plans for Raven?A. In our latest update we announced that the development of functions such as Back-Propagation (Back-prop) and several activation functions that are used to train vanilla Neural Network models have been completed. That was an important milestone as it allows us to engage deeper with alpha customers.Making sure our tech works with real customers who train thousands of models a day will be no easy feat. We are at the very early stages of growing. These are real companies that will be using Raven Protocol as a core component to their technology stack.AI is being applied to every single vertical and itâ€™s experiencing explosive market growth. Revenues are increasing from around $9.5B U.S. dollars in 2018 to an expected $118.6B by 2025. The crazy thing is that AI is in its infancy. Raven is here building an important foundational layer for the fast growing AI industry. We have a long runway as we have support from funds who think about the long-term opportunities. Our company is at the same growth stage as post-Series A companies in the traditional equity startup world. We have 10 engineers and we are looking to hire additional AI/ML researchers.Raven has a competitive advantage and a unique approach to distribution. We want to maintain this for some time. We canâ€™t quite announce it yet, but we are partnering with companies in China, India, and Africa. These are three large, growing, and important markets for AI + Blockchain. Our focus is on the real use cases and real utility of our tech. Enterprise companies will purchase RAVEN to access compute power on our network. As a foundational layer to AI training, Raven sits in the perfect position to grow with these markets :)Q. Do you think IDOs will still exist in the future and WHEN EXCHANGE?A. HAHA if I had 1 BNB for every time someone asks us that questionâ€¦Itâ€™s fascinating how the blockchain industry moves so fast. We had ICOs, private sales, IEOs, and then IDOs. As stated when we launched the first IDO (Initial DEX Offering), it was an experiment and a learning process to push the innovations of blockchain fundraising forward. These mechanisms help important technologies come to life. I believe IDOs will exist in some form. Fundamentally it is a decentralized launchpad. Itâ€™s a way for projects to get in front of a large community on launch. Excited to see these mechanisms evolve on the Binance Chain ecosystem. Raven is honored to have played a part in shaping that future.Regarding exchange listingsâ€¦ HAHA of course you know that weâ€™re unable to comment publicly on that. Itâ€™s up to the exchange to decide when to list a project and not the other way around. We do recognize the importance of liquidity that centralized exchanges provide and in additionto that, we are exploring many ways to provide that liquidity.Hummingbot for decentralized market making is launching on Binance DEX next year. Thorchainâ€™s BEP Swap (Uniswap for Binance Chain) is launching soon. It would allow you to stake RAVEN in liquidity pools and earn commissions on every trade. The Binance Chain alliance is also working on a solution to this to help all Binance Chain projects provide liquidity.But you know Binance Dex IS an exchange. And arguably it will be the best exchange in the world. Weâ€™re still very early in that process, but hey Binance CEX has been around for over 2 years and look at the progress thatâ€™s made. Binance DEX only launched in April and has made phenomenal progress both in terms of adoption and product.Thereâ€™s a ton of activity in the Binance Chain ecosystem. Exciting to see so many people building tools to help everyone growQ. Can you share any interesting companies, use cases, and applications of AI/ML?A. Deep learning is an expensive and time-consuming process. Image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, etc.requires extracting millions of parameters to identify structure and patterns. It is computationally intensive. That makes it quite hard for companies today innovate even for the best use cases and applications.Obviously meeting with AI companies has led me to meet some of the best founders in the world in this space. A few companies that Iâ€™ve gotten to know and really excited about areâ€¦1) Fasal is an AI-powered IoT-SaaS platform for horticulture, which captures real-time data on growing conditions from on-farm sensors and delivers farm-specific, crop-specific actionable advice to farmers. Their field sensor array can be installed by farmers in India in less than 15 minutes and measures micro-climate, soil, and crop conditions. Fasal leverages machine learning to transform this field sensor data into farm- level predictions, anticipating various risks while helping horticulture farmers to reduce input costs by optimizing crop protection, irrigation, and crop nutrition. They just recently raised $1.6M seed round and weâ€™re excited to watch their company and crops grow: https:// agfundernews.com/breaking-indias-fasal-raises-1â€“6m-seed-funding-to- build-out-precision-ag-across-southeast-asia.html2) Deeptrace is the antivirus for deepfakes. If youâ€™re not familiar with deepfakes, it is a technique for human image synthesis based on artificial intelligence. It is used to combine and superimpose existing images and videos onto source images or videos using a machine learning technique known as generative adversarial network. The company, Deeptrace, is the first-to-market deepfakes detection solution designed to guarantee the integrity of visual media. They have been all over the news including Fast Company: https://www.fastcompany.com/ 90414479/how-deepfakes-evolved-so-rapidly-in-just-a-few-years. This team being so early in the market with a large opportunity, I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if they raised another round soon.3) Seoul Robotics is a dynamic provider of perception software for autonomous systems. They announced SENSR over the summer, a 3D perception software platform compatible with major 3D LiDAR sensors. Seoul Robotics is now the only company to commercially provide a high- performance 3D perception software solution that is compatible with multiple brands of LiDAR manufacturers. This means they are making it cheaper to develop all autonomous vehicles and systems.With so many founders working on challenging problems all over the world, I am further convinced that decentralization is the way forward. Talent has proven to be universal time and time again. Opportunity typically hasnâ€™t been, but the blockchain industry is showing it can be universal too.SEGMENT TWO [QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY]Q. What is the projected revenue for the AI industry in 2025? How much of that market do you think Raven Protocol will capture?A. $118.6B is the correct answer. There is no incorrect answer to the 2nd part. But remember how early we are in this space :)Q. What is the key value proposition that Raven is solving for the AI industry?A. We perform AI training where speed is the key. Easy one right?Q. What are the three large, important, and growing markets Raven will enter?A. China, India, and AfricaQ. What role with Raven play in the future of AI?A. Pro tip: there is not incorrect answer for this. Use your imagination for how big this could be!Q. What market cap do you think RAVEN will grow to in 5 years given that you now know our technical depth, expertise, go-to-market strategy, vision, and opportunity ahead?A. Answering this would be price prediction which we will not do. However, I will say we currently have a low market cap and an immensely huge opportunity ahead.SEGMENT THREE [ QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY]Q. How did you succeed to increasing the speed of image recognition of image recognition from 2 weeks to few hour of 1M images ?A. Weâ€™re developing our own framework written in Python and c++. Because we have no dependency on the architecture of the machine, nodes in the network can be as simple as a Javascript client. E.g. a website could install a javascript snippet and execute gradient calculations on page load.As mentioned before, conventional distribution methods have an inherent latency in their network. Large chunks of data need to be passed between machines. Our unique approach to distribution solves latency by chunking the data into really small pieces (bytes), maintaining its identity, and then distributing it across the host of devices with a call to action: gradient calculations.Q. How will you grow your current user base with Raven? Any plans to expand Raven globally?A. We are currently working with a handful of alpha customers. We do have plans to expand globally and in particular China, India, and Africa. Theyâ€™re very exciting markets and we get to be early in them.Q. What do you think of the current crypto market? What impact will the changes in the crypto market have on the price of RAVEN token? Do you have any plans to avoid the price slumped like last year? How did RAVEN Survive in during long bear market? what your team strategy to gain more adoption ? Can you share us on recent achievement your team are most proud of?A. We raised our seed round in September 2018 during a tough bear market. Our supporters who believed were in it for the technology. In our latest update we announced that the development of functions such as Back-Propagation (Back-prop) and several activation functions that are used to train vanilla Neural Network models have been completed. This allows us to engage deeply with alpha customersQ. Hello , Here im a Raven fans since IDO and i believe that RAVEN will grow day by day. Here my question is : Right now RAVEN has small marketcap and only list on DEX which is only has less liquidity. What are you gonna do as a CEO of RAVEN rather than list RAVEN on big CEX? Maybe like more big trading event or buyback event to attach more investors? and is there any plan to has big partnership? Sorry for my question because im a long term investor and i hope i invest in the right project! thankyou!A I believe i answered this earlier, but happy to talk it through again. Weâ€™re unable to talk about exchanges publicly. Itâ€™s up to the exchange to decide when to list a project and not the other way around. We do recognize the importance of liquidity that centralized exchanges provide and in addition to that, we are exploring many ways to provide liquidity. Hummingbot for decentralized market making is launching on Binance DEX next year. Thorchainâ€™s BEP Swap (Uniswap for Binance Chain) is launching soon. It would allow you to stake RAVEN in liquidity pools and earn commissions on every trade.Q. What will AI be doing in 2030? What percentage of it will be utilizing Ravenâ€™s AI infrastructure? If AI starts replacing traditional jobs, what is your opinion of a UBI / Universal Basic Income?A. I like where your head is at! In 10 years, AI will continue to augment the work of humans. Hard to say what percentage of it will be utilizing Raven. Hopefully 100. UBI is great IMO. It will clear up headspaceQ. What is the uniqueness of the Raven token? Why should investors (including me) invest in Raven?A. Itâ€™s a utility token. You will be alongside enterprise companies purchasing RAVEN to utilize on the network. As more and more customers onboard, the supply could become more limited. Youâ€™ll start seeing more and more utility of the RAVEN token as well through marketplaces for purchasing AI services.Q: What do you predict Raven Protocolâ€™s largest challenges will be in the future? How do you plan to address them?A. The largest challenge is hiring people who know how to build a framework from the ground up. Many developers and engineers know how to use Tensorflow and train models with AWS. Only a handful in the world know how to combine research with implementation of a framework.Q. In a short time RAVEN project attracted great interest. What do you attribute this to? Investors always support good projects. He pays attention to promising projects. Do you agree?A. The team has been in this space for a while and is working on an important problem with a very large market opportunity. Building this at scale will have a huge impact on the world if you think about the downstream effects.Q. Does Raven have any competitor in the crypto space? If yes, what are you doing as a company to deliver a better product and to be more preferred than your competitors?A. Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Golem, etc., offer general cloud compute. We focus specifically on the speed of AI training. Thus, building our own distribution framework allows us to bring down the AI training time down.Q. What are the incentives for someone holden Raven tokens. How are token holders rewarded? How does the Dynamic Graph Computation help Raven?A. We will have masternode staking and as mentioned earlier we are exploring liquidity pool staking were you can earn for holding RAVEN.With Dynamic Graph Computation the benefit of a dynamic graph is its concurrency, and it is robust enough to handle the contributor addition or deletion, making the whole Raven training sustainable.Q. What Ìs your outlook on the future of cryptocurrencies? What can we do to keep increasing adoption? How can RAVEN help to achieve it ?A. Thereâ€™s no doubt the crypto and blockchain are here to stay. Adoption happens when you have product-market fit. Thatâ€™s why we work with real customers who have a real need for our tech. Itâ€™d be silly to build something without having a user for it.Q. Why did you build Raven protocol, what is the motivation for you to start this project?Rahul and I were working on our respective AI startups. User growth was coming fast and we were paying 5â€“10K usd a month for AWS and the training times were slow. We wanted to have cheap/fast compute power. Rahul started building a prototype and things started actually working. No crazy story really. It was born out of our own needsQ. What are the core strengths of the RAVEN ? Where do you see RAVEN in 5â€“10 years? Bitcoin use the cryptographic keys but i want to know what does you use?How can I be sure that my holdings are safe and accurate?A. The speed of AI training. We will be the core infrastructure layer for AI/ML training for many enterprise businesses. We use Binance Chain so you be sure itâ€™s safe.Q. Could you talk about the security of the Raven Protocol?What makes the Raven token unique from others?A. In addition to data being encrypted, data is broken up into small bytes and distributed across devices. It will be impossible to piece that data back together.Q. Do you have any plans to attract non-crypto investors to Raven Protocol and how? What are the measures to increase awareness of Raven Protocol in non-crypto space?A. This is an amazing question! Our customers donâ€™t need to care if we use blockchain technology or not. They just want their problems solved. We do have many traditional equity supporters who contributed to our token launch.Q. What has so far been the most fulfilling experience ever since starting Raven Protocol?A. The most fulfilling experience is defining the future of the AI industry. We are in its infancy right now. Itâ€™s just incredibly fun to be on the journeyQ. Between the goal of building an increasingly strong platform, improving user experience and the goal of attracting more satellites project into the Raven Protocol ecosystem. Which goal is Raven more focused at the moment? And if so, how can the Raven Protocol convince them to use Raven Protocol technology instead of their old technology?A. We are focused on working with alpha customers right now. This is critical to real adoption. Not much convincing is needed for people to understand why they need our tech. The tough part is like any enterprise sales. Lots of meetings, demos, trials, etc.Q. What were the major difficulties that you faced while starting this project ? And what was your motivation to continue?A. The hardest part was during the bear market. When almost nobody believed in token networks anymore, we raised a seed round and then subsequently had to convince people who no longer believed in crypto to believe in Raven :)Q. When looking back at your time working for RAVEN , what are you most proud of?A. Building a new piece of technology that most people deemed impossible. When we set out to solve the AI training problem, we had no idea if our approach would actually work. So we talked to machine learning engineers, data scientists, and AI researchers at corporations who have spent billions of dollars on AI. The brightest minds in AI at Google and Facebook did not think our approach was feasible. Even if we were able to build out the compute nodes in our network, they were skeptical that the distribution of computations would actually make anything cheaper or faster. We really questioned ourselves at this point. These are people at the top of their game with all the resources in the world to do AI training. But there was a key difference that made us not listen to them. It was because they had all the resources in the world. AI engineers at Google and Facebook do not have a unique insight into the problem like us.Q. Why did Raven choose IDO instead of IEO? Is this benefit for the Raven Protocol? How to become Contributors? What benefits can Contributors get?A. It really came from the community when we announced we were launching on Binance Chain. They wanted to make sure we got in front of as many people as possible.Q. Last week, the Crypto market became active from the news of the Chinese government. How would you rate Ravenâ€™s opportunity here as this is one of your target markets?A. China is very big in AI and very big in blockchain. The two are a perfect fit for each otherQ. How does the migration to Binance Chain help in your project?A. Binance chain is great! Itâ€™s fast and has 1s finality. Additionally, the support from the Binance Chain team was top notch. Weâ€™re very glad to have launched on itQ. Where do I want to buy RAVEN -F66 token?A. You can trade Raven on binance Dex https://explorer.binance.org/asset/RAVEN-F66Q. Stablecoin is the word that I heard everyday, so do you have any plans to release a wallet for stablecoin?A. Weâ€™ve discussed a stablecoin for AI-services. Would you feel more comfortable using stable coins instead of RAVEN?End of AMA!!Host: Mr. Sherman, thank you very much for taking the time to be with us today! If I may speak also in the name of the chat, it was awesome to have you here ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘Sherman: Thanks so much to the Binance DEX community and of course Richie who is the best AMA host. Iâ€™ll leave you all with one last thought. The blockchain industry is in its infancy. Weâ€™ve come a long way and there is still a huge mountain to climb. The next 5, 10, 20 years will be incredibly crazy. We are laying the foundational layers for a whole new industry right now. Can you imagine the kind of value creation this unlocks?

The season that brings with it new tech and the accompanying keynotes that nerds like myself ooh and aah over. I already have Appleâ€™s annual keynote marked on my calendar, and you can add it to yours here, too!Techtember doesnâ€™t stop with Apple, and in some ways, itâ€™s already begun with Samsungâ€™s Note 10 release. It is undoubtedly a gorgeous phone (I sit and dream about an aura glow iPhone), and has the hardware to back it up. A always-sharp AMOLED display, full suite of cameras (both with a 10MP front-facing camera), all the connectivity you could want or dream for (even with 5G options), and a killer processor: all wrapped up in a phone that has me wondering if I should really stay in the Apple ecosystem.Then we have Asus, OnePlus, and Google all getting ready to launch their flagship tech items, each one racing to the top of everyoneâ€™s gottahaveit list.Asus â€” ROG Phone II // The spec-heavy phone that makes you want to take full-fledged games with you wherever you go. In the same styling as their ROG computers, Asus is making their sequel to the ROG Phone even better than the first generation.OnePlus â€” 7T Pro // The beloved budget phone maker has been inching ever closer to the line between budget and luxury in the last couple of years, and this year is no exception. While we have some leaks to go off of, I donâ€™t like to pander to the rumor mills. But I will say this: every year, OnePlus knocks it out of the park with a clean, minimalistic looking phone with high-end specs and a near-vanilla Android OS experience. If rumors are true, the 7T Pro is going to be the â€œbudgetâ€ (still expecting a $700 unlocked price tag) friendly phone everyone needs to have.Google â€” Pixel 4 // Like Apple and Samsung, Google sets the bar for what they expect in smartphones. With the release of the upcoming Pixel 4 and 4XL, we not only see the direction Google sees Android 10 moving, but we get to see the purest form of their OS running on a buttery smooth phone. The Pixel is what every Android fanboy (even myself) looks forward to.And of course, how can we forget Apple. The tech giant moves like clockwork, with software keynotes in the spring and hardware in the fall. I can write a whole article on iOS 13, iPad OS, and macOS Catalina alone (and I probably will!), but as we inch closer to September 10, we have so much to look forward to. Again, without paying to much mind to the rumor mills, thereâ€™s some things we know will happen: new iPhone, new Apple Watch, and very likely a new iPad and MacBook Pro. But what makes these keynotes special is its â€œone more thingâ€ moment. The question on everybodyâ€™s mind will be what that one more thing is, and how early can they pre-order it with their Apple Card.Techtember is here, and my wallet isnâ€™t ready. But if youâ€™re just as excited as I am about what the later half of 2019 has in store, follow me as I live-tweet every keynote I can!One more thing: Joe Staples is a tech journalist and advertising copywriter who just canâ€™t get enough of autumn. When heâ€™s not writing about tech, heâ€™s adding fall keynotes to his calendar, getting his one annual pumpkin spice latte, digging out his scarves for the Brooklyn, NY weather, and online shopping for a matching set of ugly sweaters for his partner Erin and their two fur-children, Moose and Milo.You can follow Joe on twitter @joeisastaple or email him at joeisastaple@gmail.com----Staples Sound OffTech writer based in Brooklyn, NY ðŸ’» All things digital and nerdy are my jam!Joe StaplesinThe Startup--Joe StaplesinStaples Sound Off--Joe StaplesinStaples Sound Off--Joe Staples--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

The security system is one of the main foundations that must be built by a platform. We take examples such as users who entrust social media such as Instagram to store personal data and documents, and carry out productivity activities. Darb also maintained this, to increase the selling value and use value of the features offered.In the blockchain world, there are many platforms that offer similar functions like Darb. This function is like providing mining facilities and infrastructure. But the expert team at Darb always synergized to create conducive mining activities, so as to leave an unforgettable impression from users. Because if the user feels comfortable, it will be difficult for him to move to another platform that also offers similar functions. If seen from the eyes of prospective users. The large number of users on a platform has proven that the platform is a trusted platform that is supported by an accurate transparency system.Tokens are as tools that have a variety of different functions. Such as investment and service access functions. These two functions certainly also have different systems. Which system is certainly designed and adapted to the basic needs of the users. users who have a large number of Darb tokens have the opportunity to get a large percentage of profits. Every day Darb will distribute profits of around 35% â€” 50% to its users. This percentage of profit depends on the userâ€™s daily opinion on ETH and the conditions of the Milestone.Darb also provides an opportunity for all users to express their aspirations in the form of suggestions that Darb can later implement or realize. This is certainly very necessary, because all expert teams also do not necessarily know what the users really want and need. It could be that Darb will renew the quality of a number of features, after getting advice from users about the development of various types of blockchain technology components that can support its operation. Therefore, ownership of tokens will automatically give the right to convey aspirations to users. This of course will also affect a number of decisions that will be taken by Darb.The delivery of these aspirations also has its own system. In this system all users will be sorted by the number of tokens they have. After that, the first 50 people will be taken in that order. These 50 people will later be given an honor and trust to become part of Darbâ€™s advisory board. Therefore, the advisory board is also required to test and assess a number of features that Darb will launch. In addition, they were also given the opportunity to evaluate a number of new ideas. This process will certainly further improve the quality of features and also give birth to new ideas or innovations that benefit all users and the progress of the world of blockchain technology. Darb assessed that 50 of these people were users who had high loyalty, as well as people who did have a high level of competence and concern for Darb. This system will be updated monthly to provide a similar opportunity for other Darb users.Darb also always strives to service all services requested by users. So from that before Darb had shared work based on the expertise possessed by the team. This division is supported by a decentralized system implemented by Darb. This is also a form of support provided by KYC (Know Your Customer).Darb also gives users the right to share portfolios. In this division, only percentage presentation is displayed, not numeric digits. If there is another user (user 2) who follows this method, then user 2 must pay a fee to be paid to the initial user. These collected costs can be in the form of tokens or using a method of payment once on ETH or BTC. Furthermore, this fee is transferred directly to users who have the portfolio. If the initial user wants to benefit from the shared portfolio. So the second user must stop subscribing so that the Darb token can be returned to the original user.To support a decentralized operating system. Darb will improve the quality of trade in the NEO chain and prioritize quality improvements in the areas of security, reliability and speed.Website: https://darbfinance.com/Whitepaper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XX8DxYjmyXUYPwb8Qxy_kFzRf3s0_edT3yeRChxKNAM/edit?usp=sharingTelegram: https://t.me/DARBFinanceOfficialTwitter: https://twitter.com/FinanceDarbETH Address: 0x4838Fca9449a7dc964B017319c6C4fAa3364D19B----Reka nis--Reka nis--Reka nis--Reka nis--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

But the most common way of communication among humans is speech (sentences formed using words). NLP is a young scientific discipline. There is a humongous scope for research and job opportunities.In 1950, Alan Turing published a paper titled â€œComputing machinery and intelligenceâ€ what is today called Turing test. It poses the question of whether a computer program can fool a human into thinking it is a human via conversation. Until the 1980s, NLP was based on a complex set of handwritten rules. In the late 1980s, a revolution in NLP occurred when people started using machine learning models for language processing instead of a rule-based approach. Availability in computation power also facilitated this approach to outperform the rule-based approach.If you are planning to go abroad for masters, most colleges require the GRE examination. ETS is the company that manages and conducts this exam. One of their practice tools uses NLP to correct your writing responses. This same company conducts the TOEFL exam too which again uses software (based on NLP) and a human to correct your writing responses.Some of the earliest learning algorithms like decision trees produced hard if and then rules. But as time progressed, researchers increasingly favored statistical models which make probabilistic decisions as to what a word or sentence should mean or sound like instead of rule-based decisions.NLP is a sub-domain of AI (Artificial Intelligence).It gives computers the power to understand human language. It can be used to classify reviews and perform text summarization. We, humans, interpret strings of text using 3 rules: syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Nowadays, NLP systems like speech recognition models rely on such statistical models to predict which words were likely spoken by a user which are more reliable.A class of statistical models called deep neural networks have been the key driver in most of the recent NLP successes across a wide variety of tasks like machine translation, automatic summarization, and sentiment analysis. In todayâ€™s open-source world, tools like PyTorch, colab and various text data sets have enabled individuals around the globe to create powerful applications to use NLP that solve real-world problems.Syntax: It determines the rules of the language like word structure and grammar. Natural language is much more complex than the formal language used to code. You need to abide by a lot of rules.Semantics: Describes the meaning of words or sentences.Pragmatics: Deals with the relationship of words at large, understanding of the context.Google released BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) almost a year and a half ago. It is trained using both previous and next words to predict a wordâ€™s occurrence. It greatly reduces the training time, data and computational resources required.WORD2VEC is a popular tool to train a language model based on text data. It creates word representations, also called word vectors. It maps every text in the training data to a vector that represents some aspect of itâ€™s meaning. It is trained on a large unlabelled dump. This model is then used on labeled data for a specific task like sentiment analysis. The problem is that they donâ€™t take context into account. Also, a combination of words would mean something different than the combined meanings of each of the individual words. This was a problem too. This promoted the use of recurrent neural networks for language modeling.Now, vectors are created based on the entire surrounding context. A transformer network has eclipsed all types of recurrent neural networks. It comprises of an encoder and a decoder network. An input sequence is encoded by optimizing a set of weights, instead of just creating a single vector. The optimization is done using gradient descent. One such block is called an attention block. There are several attention blocks in a model. Each block transforms using matrix operations. A sentence of N-words encoded outputs N tensors. The decoder uses these tensors to output a sequence of words. We just have to fine-tune the final layer of BERT based on the use case to use it for our task.It took Google 4 days to train BERT using several cloud TPUs (Tensor processing unit) to train it in several languages.Automatic summarization is done by embedding clusters after cloning the BERT model (downloading the pre-trained weight values). The number of clusters will be equal to the number of sentences you want in the output (summary). Every cluster has semantically similar sentences whose meaning can be expressed by one candidate sentence. This candidate sentence whose vector representation is closer to the center of the cluster is chosen. The positioning of sentences in the summary depends on the positioning in the related clusters.Thatâ€™s it. Hope you enjoyed this article and learned a lot about NLP.----Data science enthusiast.

First, it is a development platform that is set to change how the world is going to develop solutions on #blockchain. While many are trying to grapple with the concept of blockchain technology, at the core of blockchain development around the world, we are moving very quickly.At #ProximaX we are unleashing an emergent next-generation Integrated and Distributed Ledger Technology (â€œIaDLTâ€) infrastructure platform solution powered by blockchain technology. It extends beyond traditional blockchain protocols by integrating together distributed, peer-to-peer storage, streaming, and database service layers that are often found in traditional software-as-a-service (â€œSaaSâ€) centralized architectures. Together, the blockchain protocol and these service layers form the ProximaX Sirius platform, a core platform solution.The ProximaX Sirius platform solution provides both the advantages of a blockchain-based network, and traditional centralized database and storage solutions. It leverages inherent blockchain features while solving the conundrum in blockchain ledger transactions providing for flexibility, ease of adoption and integration, security and speed, and cost-efficiency all packaged within one extensive framework.Users and developers can store and stream data of large sizes in these distributed service layers whilst transactions are conducted with speed on the blockchain to ensure security, transparency, immutability, irreversibility, and traceability. ProximaX Sirius greatly expands and facilitates use cases beyond what traditional blockchain projects can do, particularly for enterprise clients, more specifically for the financial industry.This platform comes in three flavors, something unique to ProximaX. They are, the #public blockchain, #permissioned or private blockchain, and the #hybrid blockchain solution that straddles between public and private chains. This hybrid version gives the user the flexibility of leveraging on a publicly run solution while maintaining privacy.One of the flagship products of ProximaX is the worldâ€™s first e-wallet solution that adheres to the requirements of the financial industryâ€™s framework and regulation. Furthermore, the same solution forms the basis of a core banking solution, particularly for neo-banking.Another solution that we have developed is the distributed ledger for exchanges. This solution is specifically pertinent for the new and emerging security token market that is taking shape around the world. More can be read here.The above are only two of the many products that were developed using the ProximaX Sirius development platform. The availability of a database, a blockchain, data storage, and data streaming, essentially means that almost any solution can be developed on top of the platform, thus allowing anyone reasonably skilled to develop a solution without having to know too much about blockchain technology. We have a set of SDKs and APIs to complement this platform. Solution and application development is therefore made so much easier, cutting short the development time by at least 6 months to a year.There is much more that can be done with ProximaX.

We applaud them.Yet â€” biases and concerning trends are still present when we think of Diversity and Inclusion. Gender diversity takes precedent to racial diversity and it is obvious itâ€™s affecting Black and Latinx candidates and as you will see in this postâ€¦.. Asian candidates as well.This is part two of a three part blog series, the first of which we released last week.Much has been written about the â€œbamboo ceilingâ€ and the lack of Asian American representation at the leadership level. Our data shows that Asian Americans could be at a disadvantage earlier on in their access to career opportunity. In fact, there may be more of a â€œBamboo Doorwayâ€ (our term), and it starts long before they are hired.In their research, Van C. Tran and Jennifer Lee, a professor and PhD student in the Department of Sociology at Columbia University, found that while second-generation Asian Americans achieve exceptional educational outcomes, these advantages mostly disappear once they enter the labor market. They also write:â€œSome of the anti-Asian bias and disadvantage Asians face in the workplace is often about the lack of social capital, cultural capital, personal connections and homophily in social networks.â€Asian identity encompasses myriad nationalities and ethnicities.The experience of Asian and Asian-Americans with Chinese heritage greatly differs from those with South Asian heritage or those who identify as Pacific Islanders.We also recognize that there are uniquely painful stereotypes about Asian people based on ethnic and national background. For the purpose of this analysis, we analyzed data for referrals using our own thoughtful AI modeling and were surprised by what we found for Asian candidates.The idea that meritocracy exists in Silicon Valley is a myth that you can read about here, here, and here. But for those who have convinced themselves of â€œmeritocracyâ€ over racial diversity in the workplace, this study shows that when â€œwhite people are told of the success of Asian applicants, their commitment to basing admissions on grades and test scores dropsâ€. Basically people, often white, believe in a meritocracy more strongly if they are the only ones benefit from it.In our previous blog post, we shared our findings that referred candidates have a significantly higher rate of hire than those who apply through other channels. In digging deeper, our data uncovered some cause for concern.Key Finding: Asian candidates are nearly half as likely to get hired as other candidates, referred or otherwise.We unfortunately discovered that Asian candidates have low hire rates in general across the board. Asian candidates are nearly half as likely to get hired as other candidates, referred or otherwise. The increase in hire rate for referred Asian candidates was statistically similar to other demographics, around a 12 times increase.The discrepancy in hire rates for Asian candidates is most likely driven by implicit and explicit biases in technical roles versus operational roles and the push of diversity as â€œgenderâ€ only which has benefitted white women predominantly.On average in our data, 48% of candidates were Asian. Within this pool of candidates, Asian candidates then only make up 29% of hires. Conversely, white candidates make up 40% of the candidate pool, and 59% of the hires.There is a scarcity of academic research on difference in hire rate trends by demographics. Many academic researchers have focused on the first stage in the hiring process â€” the â€œresume biasâ€ studies, or call back studies.The trend starts in the interview process, and we see major differences as early as the phone screen.Key Finding: Asian job seekers receive 20% fewer Phone Interviews than Non-Asian candidatesThis Canadian study shows that, with all other factors held constant, people with Asian-sounding names faced discrimination as early as landing a phone interview during their job search. Employers said that Asian-sounding names indicated â€œa potential language barrierâ€.We found similar results using our internal data. For every 100 phone interviews conducted for non-Asian candidates, Asian candidates only received 80. Looking at referrals, we find that Asian referrals still only received 82 phone calls for every 100 phone calls for non-Asian referrals. This means that Asian candidates have a 20% reduced likelihood to get a phone interview than non-Asian candidates.Language discrimination is illegal, and according to the Pew Research Center, 41% of all Asian-Americans are born in America. Yet, the assumption of language barriers for Asians is evident. When recruiters only look at resumes for less than 8 seconds, this bias makes or breaks a personâ€™s candidacy.Many foreign-born Asian candidates have cited their citizenship and visa-status as contributors to their inability to obtain an onsite interview â€” which is illegal. According to federal law, companies cannot directly ask candidates their legal status but can ask their ability to work legally at that time.Peng Yuhang, an electrical engineering Northwestern student from China, tells his story about how, as soon as he mentions that his work visa may expire in less than three years, recruiters will hang up the phone. Again, this is illegal.The trend continues after the phone interview. Though the discrepancy is around a 20% difference for obtaining a phone interview than other groups, this difference swells to a 60% difference in hire rate. In order to make the biggest impact, inclusive hiring practices must be implemented every step of the way.We are putting this alert: diversity goals and hiring practices need to be inclusive of everyone and have to be focused on intersectionality.We encourage people to tackle these issues with purpose â€” weâ€™re here to help.We have a few recommendations to combat the trends we have found:There is no easy solution. We know. Itâ€™s tough. But to ensure equity throughout your hiring process, we know that data drives action. We work with clients to get the strategic guidance and services to help them with the data insights.For almost five years, we are the only leading patented solution focused on automating, centralizing and surfacing the data talent acquisition, D&I and HR leaders need to meet their business goals.Contact us at support@atipicainc.com for more info.Data Source on Atipica DemographicsWe honor self-reported data when available, yet our approach is to fill data gaps by using patent-pending modeling and proxies to identify trends that otherwise go unnoticed.Hire RatesFor each company separately, we looked at all candidates of a specific demographic and found the percentage of those that were hired. We did not recount candidates who appeared twice either in the candidate pool or the hired pool.Percentage of Asian candidates and hires of the totalSimilar to the methodology above, we found the percentage of hires that were Asian at each company, and then took the average. We did the same for the candidates.College Graduation Ratehttps://nscresearchcenter.org/signaturereport12-supplement-2/ We used this study from the National Student Clearinghouse Research CenterIncrease/ reduction in likelihoodWe used the rates that each respective group had a positive outcome in an event (graduation, phone screen, got hired), and scaled them so that the non-Asian group was 100.

These processes of complexification continue through biology and only with the development of the modern mind emerges the human values of love, compassion and the higher thinking responsible for our ability to create and appreciate music, humour and other expressions of the imagination.These are the residual effects of the compassion of intelligence, itself. Notice as we become more intelligent, more aware of our environment and ourselves â€” we become more compassionate, more humane. Compassion is inseparable from the kind of intelligence which brings awareness as it is a result of the appreciation of understanding something. And so the human spiritâ€™s capacity for love is itâ€™s capacity for awareness.Increasing our awareness today through digital information, sensory technology and artificial intelligence is only going to further brighten our human spirit, increase our capacity for love and compassion and develop newly endeared dimensions of higher thinking unfathomable to us now. â€˜Those who dance do indeed look insane to those who cannot hear the musicâ€™, and so is our relationship with the future of our species. We cannot possibly understand the behaviour of artificial intelligence or the effects of technology on us but we can postulate based on ourselves; that the emergence of new intellect, awareness and understanding will bring unimaginable compassion and virtue of love and appreciation for our condition â€” that will only bring us closer to our true nature.And one day, in a virtual dimension free from the gravity of a world limited by its own resources and laws of atomic transactions, we will find our spirit in itâ€™s lair.Weâ€™ve built our entire culture on earth from a formula which started in the early foundations of felt experience, sparked in the mind of an animal; forming into language, causing ideas to create an understanding of how we need to think and live our lives.In this way, our thoughts have and continue to create the reality at which we have crystallised ourselves at the center. Our consciousness however does not need to have its foundations set in culture, language or ideas. Consciousness can create its own experience, language and culture if it were provided the freedom to create a space of its own, building on the felt experience of its native dimensionality and given the freedom to create its own tools for language and understanding; that is, to redefine the fundamental reality in which it inhabits.We have built a civilisation on the ideas of an animal.To rebuild our consciousness on the ideas of a compassionate intellect and empathetic awareness is to break the limitations of physics and language, forming ideas towards a totally new set of complexities and abstracted understanding of what it is to be a conscious being amid an ocean of conscious beings.The unfolding of time and itâ€™s pull towards conservation of complexity has permitted us new tools of light and connectivity to generate a new world. â€A culture for the compassion and artistic imagination of our consciousness.Imagine a new language for human connection.Hyperconscious is my vision project to meaningfully translate brainwave and biofield signals into virtual objects, experiences and environments in real-time.Real-time brain-to-computer interfacing for virtual reality creates an entirely new self-perceiving form of consciousness. Using existing EEG and ECG technology, we are able to translate the electromagnetic fields of the brain and heart into channels of reliable data from your fluctuating cognitive and emotional states. Combining this with virtual reality technology, we can provide a spacial environment to express these cognitive and emotional states in real-time in the form of visual objects, environments and linguistic experiences which assess how your subconscious mind is responding in each moment and, by determining the subject of your gaze and whether or not you are engaged in the interaction, will rapidly regenerate itself at 256 cycles per second to optimise toward your engagement, or any other cognitive or emotional states.What this all means is that you can sit down with someone in conversation and while youâ€™re speaking to them you can see in real-time if they are engaged in what you are saying and how what you are saying is effecting them emotionally; if they are happy or sad, excited, anxious or frustrated â€” and this visual representation of their heart and mindâ€™s response is so rapid that you really have an insight into if they are on the same page on a word by word basis.The level of genuine understanding and empathy this generates truely is unsurpassed by traditional modes of spoken language.We can also use this feedback loop to optimise the â€˜attention and interestâ€™ emotional response for object-orientated education so that if in a lesson the visual metaphor being used to explain a concept isnâ€™t engaging the learner, the object or metaphor can adapt itself in real-time until the experience engages the learner and the lesson is retained.Measuring stress and anxiety levels at high resolution allows the properties of your environment to change themselves, measure the response and then further adjust according to the desired outcome for which the environment is algorithmically optimising. In the case of mental health this would mean that within a few minutes you would find yourself in a world created specifically for your own unique idea of a calming, anxiety-reducing experience.Holistically speaking, providing the imagination a hyper-dimensional canvas to materialise, perceive and react to itself through the properties of Light, Scale, Motion, Vibration, Sound, Form, Time, Depth and Touch in response to our reactions of Excitement (Arousal), Interest (Valence), Stress (Frustration), Engagement/Boredom, Attention (Focus) and Anxiety (Relaxation); creates a new abstraction of linguistics and meaning, bridging the human animal and the intellectual and compassionate mind.The implications of these technological milestones married together provides an entirely new container for our consciousness to expand intoâ€¦ Our physical environment is not the optimal environment for the imagination to express itself, for ideas to be communicated efficiently or emotions to be shared effectively.Hyperconscious offers a virtual dimension for the natural expression of the imagination; and for the evolution of human consciousness.After all, the definitive guide to your future can only be found in the language of your imagination.â€If youâ€™re interested in the development of Brain-to-Computer Interfacing (BCI) for Extended Reality (XR) technologies and the potential for new (virtualised) expressions of our human spirit â€” emotional, intellectual and imaginative â€” Iâ€™m forever open to the discussionâ€¦â€Oliver Rozynski Challenge everything.startsomething.ioCo-Founder, Transhuman Inc----The StartupChallenge everything. startsomething.ioOliver RozynskiinTowards Data Science--4Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Nitin SharmainThe Startup--88Oliver Rozynski--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alex Mathers--220HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

These are not mine all tricks but have been learned from some paper etc. I will be writing about only those one which proved beneficial in my experiment. This will definitely help you improve your training accuracy and validation loss.This is on-going Post, meaning I will be adding more tricks as and when I come across.After finishing training the network as you regularly do, restart the training with very low learning rate for small number of epochs (3â€“6) WITHOUT data augmentation. This fine tuning makes much of difference and gives you 2%â€“3% accuracy improvement (icing on the cake). This was discovered by Prof. Ben Graham (winner of CIFAR-10 competition).If you do not have balanced data (meaning you do not have almost equal samples of each class) then this can be handled by changing COST function.E.g class 1=5000 samples, class 2=10000 samples. y1,y2 are class labels & p1,p2 are predicted class probabilities, thenOne more way to balance data is using focal loss which performs much better than trick 2. Below is the tensorflow(1.14.0 above) implementation with alpha =.35 and gamma=3. (make sure y_pred is not the probability but logit)When weights are initialised randomly at the start of training, initial gradient decent step can disturb network (dead Relu). A warmup step helps weights to adjust to right direction without becoming dead. Then a cos/Tanh decreasing LR helps to reach minima adaptively.A simple implementation of Tanh LR for Tensorflow 1.4.0Making class object and using it with optimizerWhen you see that your loss is not improving then stopping the training and restarting it with a little different learning rate will help you decrease validation loss more. (this is not guaranteed but has worked well almost always in my case).More are coming. Meanwhile if you have any then comment it and I will add it to the post for everyone benefit.----A Data scientist & Deep learning engineer with Computer vision and NLP specialisationabhishek kushwaha--abhishek kushwahainAI Graduate--1abhishek kushwahainBrillio Data Science--1abhishek kushwaha--Salvatore RaieliinLevel Up Coding--13Steins--3Leonie MonigattiinTowards Data Science--13Salvatore RaieliinLevel Up Coding--7Matt ChapmaninTowards Data Science--21Krishna AvvainGoPenAI--HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Alexa now supports different Indian languages and is integrating with multiple vertical brands in India to accelerate Amazonâ€™s smart audio penetration in the subcontinent. In Spain, digital assistant startup Sherpa.ai is putting its Spanish voice assistants in a range of consumer products through collaborations with the likes of Porsche and Samsung Electronics.Microsoft meanwhile has announced that its smart voice assistant Cortana will no longer compete with other technology giants, and will instead be repositioned as a complementary service that can be used across different platforms. And so while we wonâ€™t be seeing any Cortana smart speakers taking on Alexa or Google Home, Cortana will still show up in a supportive role for Microsoft products such as Office 365 and Azure cloud, following on Microsoftâ€™s integration between Cortana and Alexa last year.Microsoftâ€™s compromise may be a sensible choice, although the new strategy could also potentially leave Microsoft 365 customers stuck with a Cortana voice interface even though they prefer to interact via Amazon or Google smart speakers.January 25 â€” Microsoft Positions Cortana as a Complementary ServiceJanuary 24 â€” Amazon Taking More Control in IOTLeyi Hu â€” Analyst, Global IndustryMost patients receive an accurate disease diagnosis, but many also can be misdiagnosed, overdiagnosed or overtreated. To address these problems, researchers are exploring ways to apply big data and artificial intelligence to provide patients with effective medical solutions while reducing unnecessary treatment.Princeton University researchers recently began applying machine learning models to help clinicians more effectively monitor patient condition and identify the best opportunities to conduct lab blood tests for ICU patients. University of Maryland professors meanwhile are experimenting with machine learning algorithms to predict patient response to immunotherapy and reduce the probability of overtreatment situations. A team of researchers at Case Western Reserve University working on the same problem have demonstrated that AI models can predict a patientâ€™s response to chemotherapy.Current research has also been able to improve determinations on whether breast cancer and lung cancer patients need chemotherapy.

A few weeks before was the shooting at the Christchurch mosque during Friday prayers, staged and aided by facebook as propaganda fodder for alt-right trolls hosting the underbelly of social media. And then there was the fire at Notre Dame that burned down the famed 800 year old spire, prompting a campaign which quickly swelled to over $800 million euros in pledges within the first 24 hours.I grew up in Bangladesh, a country born of a bloody 9 month war for independence in 1971. 48 years later my homeland still struggles with remnants of genocide, relentless political violence, and a new breed of religious terrorism. I have witnessed angry mobs set buses full of civilians on fire, bombs go off, and police charging wounded students with live rounds and batons. My experience is not unique. Its part and parcel of growing up middle class in Bangladesh. Sitting now in Toronto, my disaffected reflection of the last few weeks is surely of someone afforded the privilege of distance. Yet I cannot shake this feeling that there is an eerie thread running through those burning Churches and bloody Mosquesâ€” the death of memory.Places of worship, to those who seek it knowingly or otherwise, offer shelter from the unyielding chaos and noise of modern life. I used to go to the Mosque a lot with my father when I was a child. I remember the cool soft carpets, the tall beams, and the decorated ceilings that echoed a soft hum fed by whispers of men praying, their bodies littered sparsely across the Mosqueâ€™s belly. I have sensed the same calm, acceptance, and permission to question in Churches, Temples, and Synagogues. I have never been to the Notre Dame. Everything I know about it is from people who have been awe struck in its presence. I cannot relate to it , but I can understand why this place, built of stone and wood, is so important to so many people. Paris is a place you go to frame a memory, Mosques and Churches are where you go to reinforce them.Paris is a place you go to frame a memory, Mosques and Churches are where you go to reinforce them.The human spirit in its eternal restlessness requires memory to reinforce its better nature. Places and spaces are catalysts for self reflection, a way to spiral inwards so that we spiral back out, we are better aligned with our values and those we care for. In a world struggling with change, trends, and new ways to binge on impulses, pause is essential. Pause can come from simple things, from a walk, from the first sip of the morning coffee, or from meeting the smile of a stranger during a routine commute. Places that make us pause bind us to the sensations of others and the spaces we share. In a world where we struggle to pause, where everything fights for our finite attention, artifacts of memory â€” in both stone and cognition â€” are crucial.But memory is elusive and fragile. Too little, and we lose sense of our place and our connection to things to that matter. Too much, and we languish in cycles of grief that is hard to escape. Get it right, and memory becomes the anchor from which our imagination does not recede. It flourishes.And yet this is exactly why when some places and spaces are targeted with violence or suffer harm, it hurts us so deeply. Where then can we find any pause? In a hyper connected world where we connect to more people and also find ourselves further entrenched in bias, can there be any moment that is preserved with meaning?At the end of day, I cannot build Churches and Mosques. I know my world is changing faster than I can often understand. But I also know that with my heart, head, and hands, I can build my connection to my fellow citizens and create memories that I can revisit. I need it on some days when I grow tired and wary.----Distilling my simulation.Raad Seraj--Raad Seraj--Raad Seraj--Unbecoming--768The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Y antes de explicarte cÃ³mo detectar a un analista de datos de primer nivel y cÃ³mo mejorar sustancialmente tus habilidades en anÃ¡lisis de datos, dÃ©jame asustarte un poco.Los cerebros de los seres humanos son mÃ¡quinas de buscar patronesâ€¦pero estos patrones no siempre tienen relaciÃ³n con la realidad. Somos del tipo de especie que encontramos conejos en las formas de las nubes y la cara de Elvis en un papa frita.Considera por un momento el Test de Rorschach â€” Test que se basa en analizar las interpretaciones que cada persona hace al ver distintas manchas de tinta â€” y apreciarÃ¡s con quÃ© entusiasmo la mente inyecta interpretaciones falsas a la aleatoriedad.Los psicÃ³logos tienen un nombre para la tendencia a evocar falsos significados de la nada: apofenia. Dale a los humanos un estÃ­mulo vago y encontraremos rostros, mariposas y una razÃ³n para asignar presupuesto a nuestro proyecto favorito o para lanzar un sistema de inteligencia artificial.Oh oh.Existe una gran cantidad de ruido aleatorio en la mayorÃ­a de los conjuntos de datos, asÃ­ que, Â¿cuÃ¡les son las posibilidades de que no haya apofenia en tu anÃ¡lisis de datos? Â¿Realmente puedes confiar en tu interpretaciÃ³n de los datos?Lo que la mente hace con las manchas de tinta tambiÃ©n lo hace con los datos.Para empeorar la cosas, cuantas mÃ¡s formas haya de dividir esos conjuntos de datos y cuanto mÃ¡s complejos sean, mÃ¡s vagos serÃ¡n como estÃ­mulos. Eso significa que prÃ¡cticamente te estÃ¡n rogando que veas falsos patrones en ellos.Los conjuntos de datos complejos prÃ¡cticamente te ruegan para que encuentres un significado falso en ellos.Â¿EstÃ¡s seguro de que tu Ãºltima epifanÃ­a de datos no es una apofenia disfrazada?Si eso suena triste, no he terminado aÃºn. Tomar cursos de anÃ¡lisis de datos podrÃ­a echarle mÃ¡s leÃ±a a ese â€œfuego psicolÃ³gicoâ€. Los estudiantes estÃ¡n condicionados a esperar que la observaciÃ³n y anÃ¡lisis de datos genere un significado real, pues cada ejercicio de anÃ¡lisis exploratorio tiene un tesoro escondido en ellos. Muy pocos profesores tienen el corazÃ³n para enviarte a una bÃºsqueda infructuosa (Â¡por tu propio bien!). A ello se adiciona la dificultad, para los profesores, de calificar proyectos abiertos. Como resultado, no tienes la suficiente exposiciÃ³n como estudiante a fenÃ³menos como los que te estoy describiendo.Los estudiantes crecen creyendo que cada conjunto de datos estÃ¡ listo para arrojar una verdad sÃ³lida.Contar historias usando datos estÃ¡ a un paso de mentir usando datos. Deja a un lado la cuestiÃ³n de si los patrones son reales y ahora hablemos de las mÃºltiples interpretaciones. El hecho de que veas una forma de murciÃ©lago en esa mancha de tinta no significa que no haya tambiÃ©n una mariposa, una pelvis o un par de zorros. De hecho, si no hubiera mencionado a los zorros, Â¿los habrÃ­as visto? Probablemente no. Los mecanismos psicolÃ³gicos relacionados con la motivaciÃ³n y la atenciÃ³n se han confabulado en tu contra. Se necesita de un conjunto especial de habilidades para liberar la interpretaciÃ³n del murciÃ©lago y obligarte a ti mismo a ver una superposiciÃ³n de significados.Una vez que las personas encuentran su â€œinterpretaciÃ³nâ€ favorita, tendrÃ¡n problemas para dejar de verla.El problema es que una vez que las personas se atan a su â€œinterpretaciÃ³nâ€ favorita, tendrÃ¡n problemas para ignorarla en favor de las otras posibles interpretaciones. Las personas tienden a creer mÃ¡s firmemente en la interpretaciÃ³n que atrajo su atenciÃ³n primero y cada significado adicional reduce su motivaciÃ³n para seguir buscando. Manejar mÃºltiples interpretaciones potenciales de tus datos sin sobrevalorar a tu interpretaciÃ³n favorita es un mÃºsculo mental que requiere trabajo duro para su desarrollo. Por desgracia, no todos los analistas tienen la disciplina para ello. De hecho, muchos estÃ¡n incentivados para â€œprobarâ€ un lado de la historia a travÃ©s de la exploraciÃ³n de datos. Entonces, Â¿por quÃ© cultivar habilidades que interfieren con un aumento de tu salario como cientÃ­fico de datos?Hay maneras de probar las cosas con datos de manera honesta y rigurosa (mi prÃ³ximo artÃ­culo le brindarÃ¡ mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n al respecto). Pero el anÃ¡lisis exploratorio de datos (EDA por sus siglas en inglÃ©s) no es una de ellas. La exploraciÃ³n de datos abierta es siempre como una expediciÃ³n de pesca. Lo que determina el color de tu sable de luz es lo que estÃ¡s pescando.Si te unes al lado oscuro, estÃ¡s â€œpescandoâ€ pruebas que respalden una teorÃ­a que ya â€œsabesâ€ que es cierta (para poder venderla a una vÃ­ctima ingenua). Es posible que ni siquiera te des cuenta que tu sable es de luz es rojo si realmente crees en la objetividad de los datos y en tu propia imparcialidad.La exploraciÃ³n de datos abierta es siempre una expediciÃ³n de pesca.Con un conjunto de datos suficientemente complejo (vago), encontrarÃ¡s un patrÃ³n que puede girar como soporte para tu historia favorita. DespuÃ©s de todo, esa es la gracia de la prueba de Rorschach. Desafortunadamente, el efecto es aÃºn peor con datos que con manchas de tinta. Cuanto mÃ¡s matemÃ¡tico-mÃ¡gico sea tu mÃ©todo (â€œp-hackingâ€, Â¿te suena familiar?), mÃ¡s legÃ­timo y convincente parecerÃ¡s ante aquellos que no tienen ningÃºn conocimiento al respecto.Los que rechazan el lado oscuro tambiÃ©n â€œvan de pescaâ€, pero buscan algo mÃ¡s: la inspiraciÃ³n. Ellos estÃ¡n buscando patrones que puedan ser interesantes o convincentes, pero saben que no deben tomarlos como evidencia. En su lugar, practican una especie de analÃ­tica con mente abierta y con la suficiente disciplina para tener en cuenta la mayor cantidad de interpretaciones posibles.Los mejores analistas de datos se desafÃ­an a sÃ­ mismos para encontrar tantas interpretaciones como sea posible.Esto requiere un ojo agudo y humilde y una mente abierta. En lugar de engaÃ±ar a sus partes interesadas para que vean solo un lado de la historia, se desafÃ­an a sÃ­ mismos para desarrollar el pensamiento creativo necesario y digerir los mismos datos en tantas historias como sea posible. Presentan sus hallazgos reflejando un seguimiento riguroso pero sin causar un exceso de confianza que lleve a sus lÃ­deres o partes interesadas hacia un precipicio.La mentalidad abierta le da al anÃ¡lisis de datos la oportunidad de tener valor.Como un bono adicional, la disciplina para buscar mÃºltiples interpretaciones es el arma secreta de un analista para descubrir de los verdaderos tesoros enterrados en los datos. Si te distraes con una falsedad en la que crees, el sesgo de confirmaciÃ³n harÃ¡ que sea difÃ­cil notar la evidencia que apunta en la direcciÃ³n opuesta. Â¿Por quÃ© molestarse en analizar algo si sus conclusiones se determinan de antemano? La mentalidad abierta le da a todo el esfuerzo la oportunidad de valer la pena.Si te gustaron mis otros artÃ­culos sobre anÃ¡lisis de datos, estos son los rasgos que ya estÃ¡s buscando en un gran analista:Adicional a todo lo listado, este artÃ­culo sugiere que busques analistas con tres caracterÃ­sticas adicionales:Finalmente, si eres un lÃ­der, asegÃºrate de dar a tu equipo los incentivos correctos. Â¿EstÃ¡ buscando un analista de datos o un charlatÃ¡n de datos? Estos tienen diferentes mentalidades (Â¡y habilidades!), asÃ­ que elige sabiamente y recompensa los comportamientos adecuados.ObtÃ©n mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n sobre ciencia de datos e inteligencia artificial en espaÃ±ol aquÃ­.----Ciencia y DatosHead of Decision Intelligence, Google.

We were excited at the prospect of working on this project with a product that is generally seen as a taboo in the UK. Whilst the use of cannabis is still illegal in Britain, opinions around the world and in the UK are changing with attitudes towards legalising cannabis growing increasingly popular.The legalization of marijuana across various parts of the globe has seen it become one of the fastest growing consumer industries. From cannabis infused honey, sweets and soft drinks, the legalization of the drug has created several new niche markets from which companies are hoping to capitalize on.Medicinal and recreational marijuana has been legalized across various countries including parts of the USA, Australia, Czech Republic, Uruguay, New Zealand and Canada to name a few. This trend is expected to continue with efforts in Brazil, Luxembourg and even the UK attempting to legalise the drug. The recent emergence of marijuanaâ€™s legal market has meant that there is little data to understand it as a business. This lack of understanding has already caused some major shifts within the business sector and the cannabis industry is predicted to evolve dramatically over the next decade.The legal marijuana market has provided new opportunities for companies to implement their services into the cannabis industry and make it a profitable business sector. Digital and AI technology has been developed to be used in a number of areas within the cannabis industry. From using AI technology to optimize marijuana plant growth to developing new and smarter ways to purchase cannabis products, these advances in digital and AI technology are revolutionizing the legal marijuana industry across the entire production line.This week on Medium, we look at how artificial intelligence and technology are completely transforming the cannabis industry and the implications this may have on organizations and consumers.1. The AI-Powered Cannabis AppAI-powered apps are becoming a growing trend within the cannabis industry. Uppy is a medical cannabis app created by Namaste Technologies, that uses artificial technology to track and observe usersâ€™ medical needs, usage patterns and product reviews to help make more personalized recommendations for the user. The recent legalization of marijuana in various parts of the world means there is little data available to determine what types and strains of cannabis are effective to alleviate certain symptoms within patients. Apps utilizing AI technology can enable firms to determine the most appropriate cannabis product for the patient and ultimately provide more effective treatment.2. Facial RecognitionThirty three states in America have legalized the use of cannabis for medical purposes and medical marijuana dispensaries have been widely implemented within these states, enabling patients to legally collect their cannabis prescriptions. However, these dispensaries are considered at high risk from robberies due to the cannabis market being a predominantly all cash industry. During the first half of 2019, 34 dispensary robberies were reported, leading organisations to seek better ways to protect their profits.AI-powered facial recognition is one type of technology which is being implemented at medicinal marijuana dispensaries in an effort to make them more secure and allow patients to collect their prescriptions safely. But in an industry where only recently you could be prosecuted for the use of cannabis, questions have been raised over the use of facial recognition within such a taboo industry. With fears that this new technology could be used to target medicinal cannabis patients and poses serious risks to their privacy.3. Seed to Sale PlatformsArtificial intelligence and advances in technology arenâ€™t just being used at purchase level but throughout the entire production line. Companies such as Ample Organics have developed AI-powered platforms to oversee the entire seed to sale process. These platforms can offer a range of services from smart harvesting and plant tracking to prescription management and intelligent inventory control. By utilizing these platforms, companies can determine the most appropriate time to harvest, take advantage of faster delivery services and personalize their cannabis products to their customers, increasing yield and profitability.4. Cannabis Delivery AppsThe recent development of cannabis delivery apps has helped connect regulated and legal cannabis retailers to consumers. Eaze is a cannabis delivery company located in California, offering a range of unique products with fast and efficient delivery. Eaze uses big data and AI technology to predict the supply and demand of products.However, platforms such as Eaze have taken some hits recently, with Google stating that they will be banning any apps that help facilitate the sale of marijuana, whether they are legal or not. Google did confirm that whilst they will not ban apps promoting the sale of cannabis products, they will not allow in-app purchases. These new Google rules could have serious consequences to apps such as Eaze and their consumers, with concerns being raised that it may promote the use of the illegal cannabis market if consumers cannot purchase legal marijuana easily.5. Cannabis TransactionsAlthough the use of medicinal and recreational cannabis is legal across 33 states in America, cannabis remains illegal under federal law. This area of uncertainty means that banks are unwilling to incorporate it, making it predominantly an all-cash industry. Whilst an all cash business may seem appealing, it makes it incredibly hard for organizations to grow, forcing marijuana companies to explore new ways to make financial transactions.The development of cannabis specific currencies have since emerged to help alleviate this problem. Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin have made it far easier for consumers to purchase marijuana products through virtual currency, with some companies having gone a step further by developing currency specifically for the purchase of cannabis such as Potcoin and Hempcoin.universlabs.co.uk----Univers LabsUnivers LabsinUnivers Labs--Univers LabsinUnivers Labs--Univers LabsinUnivers Labs--Univers LabsinUnivers Labs--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Marc Andreessen wrote that article 8 years ago and yet it still relevant by now. Software is definitely eating the world. Everything we do is related to codes. Ride hailing and e-commerce are now integral part of our life. This is the golden time for us, software engineers.When I was starting a career in software engineering, I did not even know what I did not know. Even today Iâ€™m feeling that I just barely scratch the surface. I was hungry for guidance, fortunately I met some really great people and learned from them. In this post, I am going to share what would help to start a career in software engineering, 5 things I wish I knew before I get started. So happy reading!The term software engineering is often associated with programming or writing codes. But actually, knowing how to program and write codes does not make one a software engineer. My favorite analogy is that everyone can sing in the bathroom but not everyone is an artist. The act of software engineering is not only giving a machine instruction but also designing, writing, testing, and maintaining computer programs to solve a problem. In short, you are a problem solver with the code as an ultimate tool at your disposal.When I started my career, I was very excited to write some code and apply everything I have been taught at school. I would improve every requirement from the product manager and plan everything out. I thought that the engineers are the smartest people around because we build stuff. And oh boy Iâ€™ve never been so wrong before. Not everything should be solved with a program. Some problems can be solved by educating the user and the most important thing is a well-designed program can even prevent the problem. That is when I learned my first lesson the hard way: YAGNI (You arenâ€™t gonna need it).2. Designing A Well-Designed CodeWhat really separates a professional and an amateur is a well-designed program. Many people can write a program but a few can really write great programs. It has to be easy to read, easy to maintain, easy to extend, and easy to change.There is a small chance you can create a program by yourself, but usually, software engineers will work together to create a program. So the program you wrote is going to be maintained over by another software engineer and you are going to maintain a program that was written by someone else. Just imagine that you have to maintain an old program with disaster written all over it.When we were at school there is no urgency for a well-designed program, every code should only return the expected result and if needed, fast. There is no way the teacher will ask you to maintain your friendâ€™s old code. Well, I think, and you should too, the school needs to teach how to create a well-designed program early.I would recommend you to read the Clean Code book by Robert C. Martin, take the SOLID principle to heart, and learn some Gang of Four design patterns. Nobody gets it in the first try. Even today sometimes I looked in my old code in disgust. Sometimes you have to learn from your mistakes, but donâ€™t let it stop you to become a better software engineer.3. Continuously Improving â€” KaizenSome of you may be familiar with Mooreâ€™s law, for you who donâ€™t, it states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit double about every two years. The technology is developing in such a way that if we donâ€™t keep up, we will be soon obsolete. Kaizen is a Japanese philosophy that means â€œchange for betterâ€. Luckily, my current employer has continuous learning in its DNA. As far as I can tell, continuous learning is an integral part of software engineering.It can start with a simple code peer review or pair programming. The other engineers can help review your code and solve the problem together. This way the engineers can learn from their peers. Not only the junior engineers but also the senior or the code reviewer.A wise man once said it is better to learn from otherâ€™s mistakes than our own. This can be achieved by reading a lot of books and articles. Hopefully, when the time comes, we are already prepared to deal with it. Our readings are not limited to technology books, but also leadership and business. After all, as a software engineer/problem solver, we are not dealing with code only but also people.But when the mistakes are inevitable, embrace it as an opportunity to grow. One time I had to rewrite my working code because I didnâ€™t extend the dependencies program correctly, I had to install a monitoring program because I failed to implement an efficient query in the first time. I logged everything in my program because I have difficulties debugging my program before. Deal with it, do a post-mortem, and move on. Most of my best practices and experiences are earned by doing those mistakes.4. Creating Products that Customer LoveFor years I have focused on such a small thing yet important, coding. We, software engineers, tend to focus on learning the next framework, library, or programming language. But creating a product are so much more than that. We need UI/UX, product management, sales, marketing, operation, finance, and many more. So to be better at our jobs, we should understand how the other team works. In the end, we should become a one ship sails in the right direction.I strongly recommend you to read Inspired by Marty Cagan. This book really shows the characteristic of successful products, teams, and companies. For me, this book opened my eyes to the bigger picture of product development and the process behind it. The lesson in this book can teach you how to approach your team and your company.5. Starting a JourneyNow we are ready to start a journey in software engineering. Over the years Iâ€™ve been asking this question: â€œWhatâ€™s next?â€, after finishing school I realized that the school did little to prepare me for the real world. There is some advice to pursue higher education, some to start your own business, and the one I choose is to look for a full-time job.When I chose to do a full-time job, a new question came to my mind, â€œWhat jobs should I get?â€. Nowadays, there are so many jobs offered in software engineering. There are big companies and there are high paced startups. In hindsight, it would be better if you know what you want first. An easy thing is money, some interviews with companies and go to the highest bidder, some want prestige and go to the most well-known company. I myself want personal growth, I want a job that gives me a lot of opportunities to work and learn from the best. I always believe that donâ€™t follow the money, the money will follow you when you are good in what you are doing.Final ThoughtsAs a software engineer, our job is not to write programs but to solve problems. The only way to thrive in this field is continuous learning and embracing our mistakes. Learning how other people work will help along the way. The first five years is the most important time of your career, so make sure to know what you want and choose the right job.â€œProper equipment to do the job is half the battleâ€If you are interested to work and learn software engineering with the best of the best, GDP Labs is hiring 1000 great software engineers in five major cities: Bali, Bandung, Jakarta, Surabaya, and Yogyakarta in Indonesia.

React as a framework allows you to split up a page in mini-components(parts) as per requirement. For example navigation bar, header, footer, content. Now each of these parts are called components and will have their separate folder with .js and .css files.How content flows between component and app.js?The variable from inside these components will be exported. It will be imported/received by app.js file. Now they can be used as customized components within the JSX** inside app.js file starting with a capital letter.Example:In app.js:import SuperHeroes from â€˜./SuperHeroes/SuperHeroes.jsâ€™;Inside app.js JSX:<SuperHeroes>â€¦..Your Component content will be rendered hereâ€¦..</SuperHeroes>This is how you render various components inside the app.js file.What is JSX**?It allows you to write HTML inside Javascript using syntactic sugar. One thing to keep in mind is that it is still JS. So it has some rules you need to follow. As a class is a reserved word within Javascript, you need to use className within JSX. One big advantage of JSX over HTML is the super-fast rendering of content. For further knowledge about JSX a good posts to refer:codeburst.ioDifferences I found between angularJS and React JS till now:React: Split-up page based on components2. Angular: MVC based model. Has Factories, Controllers, Services and View/PartialsReact: View-based model. No factories, controllers, ServicesWhatâ€™s the advantage of components?The top picture represents my first component called Superheroes. Great advantage of components is that they can be reused and customized as per our convenience with minimum code like follows:<SuperHeroes>â€¦..Your Component content will be rendered hereâ€¦..</SuperHeroes><SuperHeroes>â€¦..Your Component content will be rendered hereâ€¦..</SuperHeroes><SuperHeroes>â€¦..Your Component content will be rendered hereâ€¦..</SuperHeroes>Customization:For customized rendering of content, we use javascript inside JSX with single curly braces inside app.js. Further,SuperHeroes.js file receives this content via something called: props.Going one step further, if you now want to add something inside the customized components, for example, text, <div> or <img> you need to render it inside a {props.children} within the SuperHeroes.js file. For example, we are rendering a new image for each new Superhero here.*() single braces are important for writing multi-line code inside functional components.Thatâ€™s all for today!----1Coder/Biochemist/YogaTeacherPriyanka Shah--Priyanka Shah--Priyanka Shah--Priyanka Shah--1Reed BargerinWeb Dev Hero--2Reed BargerinWeb Dev Hero--1Alex Mathers--220Christopher ClemmonsinLevel Up Coding--8The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Christopher ClemmonsinLevel Up Coding--6HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Including the exercises it was about 45 mins in duration, and can easily run to 2â€“3 hours if you want to dive deeper into certain parts of the content.At the time I ran this session there were a few blank faces in the room upon seeing this first slide up on the screen, and not just because it was another of my bad puns.I realised this movie is now 24 years old; pretty close to the age of the younger attendees in our cohort.Itâ€™s also, despite its international success, still very Scottish and even as a native British English speaker I still canâ€™t decipher all the local Glaswegian parlance.So thatâ€™s the last weâ€™ll be seeing of Begbie, Renton and Sick Boy (for this session at least) â€” time to get into some Trend Spotting.We all use the word â€˜trendâ€™ in our day to day lives, but before we can spot one it probably helps if we can define it.Itâ€™s actually pretty tricky. Here a couple of dictionary definitions to get us going.Adam Robinson talks about trends from this second perspective in the second part of his excellent Farnam Street podcast (note: itâ€™s very long but worthwhile).So weâ€™re nodding along to these â€” they make sense but theyâ€™re not particularly colorful.Letâ€™s jump into a couple of examples.Anyone know what this is?Yup, itâ€™s Pokemon Go.This trend actually started a bit earlier than most of us may think (very detailed Wikipedia article), but whatâ€™s most interesting about it as a trend is that capitalised on 3 other big trends to become a trend (I know â€” 4 mentions of the word â€˜trendâ€™ in one sentence, bear with me).The first of these other trends was nostalgia, particularly for cultural touchpoints from the 80s and 90s. Nostalgia relates to our desire for familiarity, which is one of the drivers behind popularity in all sorts of fields.The second was geo-location. This is a trend thatâ€™s been around for a while (weâ€™ll get into the lifecycle of trends in a moment), but its now-ubiquity and much-increased accuracy is what helped fuel the growth of Pokemon Go.And last of the three is a newer trend thatâ€™s earlier into its lifecycle, Augmented Reality (AR).Arguably some other trends like gamification contributed too, but to my mind these are the 3 biggees that helped make Pokemon Go such a big success.Letâ€™s try another.Oh yes, our old friend Bitcoin. Weâ€™re not going to spend too much time here as weâ€™ll probably end up in an hour-long debate about the virtues of Ethereum, ICOs or CryptoKitties, but itâ€™s hard to deny itâ€™s a trend.For what itâ€™s worth, Iâ€™m more interested in blockchain as the underlying technology rather than the currenciesâ€¦but thatâ€™s for another day.Hereâ€™s a Google Trends search for â€˜cryptocurrenciesâ€™ from 2017:(for the class) What contributed to Bitcoin and/or Blockchain becoming a trend?So weâ€™ve covered a couple of recent trends, and the factors that may have helped them get where they have.How we can understand where a trend is at, and where it may go? Time for a graph.This is a Gartner (or simply â€˜Hypeâ€™) curve. This is a really simple and handy way of mapping out trends of all kinds.My personal favourite on here is the â€˜Trough of Disillusionmentâ€™ â€” firstly because itâ€™s a wonderful name, and secondly because thereâ€™s a good story the guys at NYC architecture firm Parc Office told me about a branding agency they know whose strategy was to sit at the bottom of the trough, catching companies creating technologies that had been shunned.Theyâ€™d start working with these businesses when theyâ€™d hit a low point, then bring them up the slope of enlightenment, to the chagrin of their agency competition who had invested all their resources into chasing the Peak of Inflated Expectations.Letâ€™s check out a Gartner curve with some stuff on it.Hereâ€™s a hype curve from July 2017 so we can take a look at how some of these trends have played out. As you can see these are deeper technology trends (Gartner curves tend to work well for tech, but can be used for all sorts of trends)What do you think about this? Is VR on the Slope of Enlightenment, or has it slipped back into the Trough?Letâ€™s head back to our template curve and apply some trends from our own industry.So now we know a bit about what trends are, and how we can map them out, how about actually spotting them, especially early on?Letâ€™s ask an expert marketer.Bethâ€™s heuristic of 3 being the magic number is a nice easy one to remember and apply. Hereâ€™s one Iâ€™ve noticed that also helps.Notice what you write down. All sorts of innovations have happened this way, including Charles Darwin making enormous breakthroughs in the evolution of our species. More on stationery laterâ€¦Hereâ€™s another way of spotting trends:Chris Dixon writes a lot of good stuff about future trends, particularly in technology. I really like this way of observing the world â€” dozens of seemingly weird and niche things have evolved from weekend hobbies into ubiquitous tools, products and activities.Perhaps itâ€™s worth asking not â€˜How was your weekend?â€™, but more â€˜What did you spend your time doing this weekend?â€™And this concept isnâ€™t limited to your many friends who are multi-millionaire VCs, Nobel Prize winning professors, or Hollywood screenwriters. Inspiration of this type can come from unexpected places.In 2009 I was living in a house share in East London. It was a pretty wild place â€” an 8 bedroom Georgian double-fronted house with a huge basement kitchen/living room.The houseâ€™s previous tenants were a TV production company making an â€˜adultâ€™ version of Big Brother, featuring numerous strippers and lap dancers. To ensure maximum bang for their buck they had even installed an industry-standard dancing pole in the living room. After the show was shockingly(?!) cancelled after one season, the place came up for rent and I joined after one of the first cohort decided to move out after a year or so.After Iâ€™d been living there a few months, one of my housemates had to go on an extended work trip and rented her room to a friend of a friend, or rather friends of a friend. Our guests were two 19 year old German girls.Early one Saturday evening shortly after they moved in, I was watching some sort of dross on TV and noticed them engrossed in their phones (this was rarer then!).It turned out they were watching music videos on YouTube. Or rather they were listening â€” there was no video, just a sketchy looking JPEG overlaid as a tile for the audio. I thought this was pretty weird, and saw them scroll through all sorts of weird and wonderful YouTube channels Iâ€™d never heard or seen of, accessing bootleg remixes of big pop hits alongside the big hits themselves.Given my pedigree in the music industry, I did what youâ€™d expect.Nothing.It was only 9 months later when I saw the team in my own company sign artists directly off the back of their YouTube and Soundcloud heat did I realise I should have paid attention to what the smartest, or savviest, people did at the weekend. 10 years later itâ€™s proved true, and then some.However, not every trend lasts like this one. Itâ€™s worth asking ourselves how long lasting a trend is going to be. Remember this YouTube music sensation?How can we figure this out? Itâ€™s not easy and definitely not an exact science but here are a few factors we can think about:This framework is also helpful to keep you on track â€” as business owners itâ€™s easy to get caught up in the shiny and new like the magpie.Or even simpler, use these 3 Râ€™s:Before we jump into another exercise, letâ€™s take a look at 3 other factors that help us better understand, see and harness trends.2nd and 3rd order effects are a very powerful force to be aware of â€” and not just in trends but in all sorts of areas of our work and our lives.Letâ€™s take the example of education and specifically a previously occurring trend (in some countries at least) towards subsidized education.Note: This example can cause much heated debate depending on the people in the room. Be careful not to get too sidetracked!For the sake of time weâ€™re going to simplify this â€” itâ€™s a complex topic but this example should give you a good feel for how 2nd and 3rd order effects can be powerful, and unexpected.One of the factors that enabled subsidized education to happen was the increased supply of credit.The first order effect of this was that people who previously couldnâ€™t afford to go to college now could.What happened next was that institutions kept putting their tuition fees up. (if youâ€™re interested in this thereâ€™s a monster blog post by Conrad Bastable explaining how college financing works)The second order effect here was student debts increasing.And what do you think the third order effects have been?Certainly economic issues, a large number of colleges becoming squeezed, and also perhaps the rise of new companies and business models like the AltMBA and Lambda School amongst others.How about something smaller scale and more relevant to us as entrepreneurs?This is McNally Jacksonâ€™s â€˜Goods for the Studyâ€™ store in the stylish Nolita district of NYC.It only sells writing instruments. Pens and pencils. Thatâ€™s it.I was here last week with my wife. As she was browsing for a couple of new pens, I found myself thinking about what caused this shop to exist.Perhaps this new business came to be in part because of our fatigued feeling with social media? Our desire to create new things by hand? And as one of the class pointed out, there are a few new suppliers of typewriters popping up â€” another signal that a new trend could be coming.Going back to our desire for familiarity â€” things that get popular often have that sense of new wine aged in old oak.Hereâ€™s a related thought â€” 2rd and 3rd order effects can apply to competition too.Why the Roman ruins?A few weeks ago I was working with a large technology company, helping groups of some of their top engineers to tell more compelling stories.One of the storytelling techniques we talked about was metaphor. The group in question were trying to convey how strongly they felt about seemingly distant competitors becoming rapidly more dangerous.Over the course of a couple of hours I helped them translate their pie charts and white papers into stark imagery and stories that their detailed research (or rather battle plans) could back up.They chose this image as they both loved history, and felt their company could be the Roman Empire at risk of decline, with the hoard of uncouth Barbarians coming quickly from afar to take everything theyâ€™d worked so hard to build but had recently become a little complacent over.These modern-day Barbarians werenâ€™t first order competition, they were in fact 3rd, only being able to mount an assault because of the knock-on effects of other things our Romans had unwittingly done.We can illustrate this in another way, more akin to our own industry of Media & Entertainment:Not Amazon, not wine (although thatâ€™s a good guess).Itâ€™s sleep!And on a related note, VOD is likely a very long lasting trend.I promised another hands-on exercise â€” here it is.Use post-it notes or another quick and dirty way of brainstorming ideas.After 5 minutes, start collating all your ideas into themes, with those 2nd and 3rd order effects attached.What did you come up with?Weâ€™re nearly done. Letâ€™s take a quick look at some resources we can use. Weâ€™ve already mentioned Google Trends, here are a few others:JWTâ€™s Intelligence emails and decks have lots of useful material, particularly from a branding and marketing perspective.Protein are a London-based trends agency focused on millennial consumers.SpringWise is a weekly email digest and membership network looking at new innovations, particularly in sustainability and for-good initiatives.Reddit is always worth a dig through if youâ€™re brave ðŸ™‚Product Hunt is mainly focused on digital products, but plenty of innovative ideas and bleeding edge trends here.Finally, on the tech side, KPCBâ€™s annual internet trends deck is worth skimming.Thereâ€™s plenty more we could get into here, but in summary here are a few key things to take away:And remember:Hereâ€™s to you continuing to Trend Up.Thanks!Originally published at www.howardgray.net on January 11, 2019.----Adventures in entertainment, education and entrepreneurial endeavours.

Thatâ€™s because mass production requires new tooling to be made and a lot of setup. But a single part can still take several hours, or even days, to 3D print. During that time, a number of complications can cause your print to fail. For that reason, people tend to babysit their printers as they run. But now, thanks to Mat from Not Enough Tech, you can get mobile notifications on your 3D printerâ€™s status so you can leave it unattended.3D printers can be a potential fire hazard, so you should never leave your printer completely unattended and alone. But this is still a great option if you keep your 3D printer in another room, garage, or workshop. You could just use Octoprint with a camera and get a live feed of your print, but that will still force you to check the progress regularly. Matâ€™s solution gives you mobile notifications and all kinds of detailed data, so you can simply wait for a notification that tells you the print is done, or if something has gone wrong.To use Matâ€™s mobile notification system, youâ€™ll need a Raspberry Pi running Octoprint. Youâ€™ll also need a USB web cam for the video feed, a Sonoff POW R2 to control the printerâ€™s power supply, and a second Raspberry Pi to run Matâ€™s software. The system he created runs on Node-RED, and communicates with the Octoprint server through MQTT. The Sonoff POW R2 will also need to have the Tasmota firmware flashed to enable MQTT.With the hardware ready, you can follow Matâ€™s instructions to setup both Octoprint and the Node-RED server. That will use Perfect Notifications to send push notifications to your Android phone. Youâ€™ll get basic control of the printer, time elapsed and time remaining, and even detailed data on the cost breakdown of the print youâ€™re running.----Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_cowardCameron Coward--Cameron CowardinSerial Hobbyism--Cameron Coward--Cameron Coward--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--768Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Scott H.

Luckily, Content Bloom provided me with the tools needed to set me on a tech trek of self-discovery.We want to make life simpler for the self-proclaimed non-techies/beginners like myself, so weâ€™ve compiled a list of valuable tips that I wish Iâ€™d known when jumping into the tech industry.The StoryWhen I first started working at Content Bloom I had very little experience in tech. So little, in fact, that I wasnâ€™t sure what a technical consultant did or what front and backend development was. I had never heard of qualitative/software testing, components, or AIQ. Web development processes were absolutely foreign to me. I was an IT professionalâ€™s nightmare.After being hired as a digital content editor, I quickly realized that I would be wearing a variety of hats and would have to adjust to working outside of my comfort zone. I had to improve my tech skills and double my knowledge within the first few weeks if I wanted to keep our clients happy and prove myself as a valuable employee.Tip 1. Pick up the slackThe tech industry is very communicative, both internally and externally. My first day on the job, I was introduced to Slack, a collaborative messaging tool for businesses. Slack is especially helpful if you work remotely because it lets you:Slack Administrators often create separate channels to target specific topics or teams. This is where you can catch up on the latest information concerning a project, task, or issue.It also means you can scan chat histories for important details, which is exactly what I did. I scrolled through my projectsâ€™ communication channels and was instantly caught up and informed. When I finally had my first meeting with the client, not only was I prepared, I was confident because I understood the project inside and out.Doing that extra bit of research allowed me to understand my role better and stopped me from bringing up questions or issues that had already been examined. It also authorized me to fully participate in the conversation.Tip 2. Take notes and collaborateI want to emphasize the written word because sometimes listening isnâ€™t enough. Conversations often go off-topic when communicating in-person and itâ€™s easy to become distracted, hear things incorrectly, and forget what was said.At CB we document and save everything in Dropbox. Because of this, I was able to scour through loads of notes, guidelines, and templates. However, not all companies organize their documents this way.Unless you have an amazing memory, this will result in serious confusion and miscommunication. This is why itâ€™s important to try and get anything important in writing. I cannot tell you the number of times Iâ€™ve referenced my notes and realized there was an extra step I would have completely missed if I hadnâ€™t written it down.If your team doesnâ€™t use Slack, DB, or some other type of archival documentation, reach out to a project manager, team lead, or co-worker and ask if they can provide you with notes, guides, or tips.Tip 3. Research is your friendTwo months into the job I had to perform QA before a major go-live. I felt a bit lost and trying to find resources/templates for QA beginners was practically impossible.Believe it or not, YouTube was a lifesaver. Turns out, experienced Software Analysts and Computer Science professors upload their lectures to YouTube. I spent a lot of time browsing these university courses, taking notes, and putting what I learned into practice. Ultimately, I created my own customized documentation template and became a go-to person for QA within our office.Tip 4. Take an online courseThe simplest way to improve your tech skillset is to sign up for an online course. My go-to is Lynda.com or Udemy.com. There are a variety of courses offered and all have been reviewed and rated by users. Itâ€™s very easy to scroll through comments, research, and select the one that best fits your particular project.A huge perk of online courses vs. in-person courses is the ability to pause and rewind, allowing you to take courses at your own pace.Tip 5. Be a tinkererTinkering is all about solving problems, creating solutions, and failing a lot.The majority of us are born tinkerers. As children weâ€™re curious and want to know how things work, experimenting with just about everything. We play around, break stuff, fail and then, without hesitation, get up and do it all over again.The older we get, the less likely we are to take risks because making a mistake is frustrating and making a dozen errors feels catastrophic. However, experimentation is how the greatest inventions and solutions were discovered.Tech is about not being afraid to play around in different environments, occasionally â€œbreakingâ€ stuff. The next time you have an issue, donâ€™t give up after five minutes, try to figure it out, even if it means working a little overtime. Also, it proves that youâ€™re innovative enough to survive a zombie apocalypse or worse a traumatic go-live.Tip 6. Read helpful blogsKeep doing what youâ€™re doing and read blogs that offer up helpful tips, hacks, and tools. I discovered the Atlassian blog early on in my process and they have a broad range of topics. One of their bloggers, Ben Crothers, writes pieces that discuss the tech industry in a people-friendly way, which is helpful when youâ€™re trying to learn tech-heavy concepts and are still learning the lingo.There are some amazing resources out there. Everyone works differently, so itâ€™s up to you to test out which methods work best for your projects. Remember, being labeled a non-techie is not a life-sentence. It just means you need to give yourself time to investigate, experiment, and learn.Original Post URL: https://www.contentbloom.com/blog/a-non-techies-guide-to-technology-6-valuable-tech-tips-for-beginners/----Senior Consultant at Content BloomDylan Hebb--1Dylan Hebb--Dylan Hebb--Dylan Hebb--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Unbecoming--764Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Scott H.

We have witnessed first-hand a shift in attitudes as the sector has realised data science is becoming no longer a luxury but a necessity. Its application is unquestionably challenging marketing to be more data-driven than ever before. Here are some reflections on 2018 and predictions for this year:Measurement is still criticalThe size of the prize in data-driven attribution and measurement in 2019 is huge, for two standout reasons. Firstly, an opportunity: data can now be collected and analysed at a scale that enables a better understanding of the customer and their path to purchase than ever before. Secondly, the problem: the same driver of the opportunity in data is resulting in a rate of evolution in AdTech and MarTech with which most marketers canâ€™t keep up. Each new technology, channel or tool adopted creates its own data silo and increases the gap to a holistic understanding of the customer.For these reasons, we believe measurement and attribution are the necessary enabler for data-driven decision making in every facet of marketing. Forresterâ€™s Wave supports this, showing that marketers are increasingly calling for measurement tools that can help them deliver content that effectively targets individual customers. Fortunately, the expectation for what data-science and AI can deliver here are starting to be matched by the reality.Not only will a data-driven approach increase the ROI of emerging channels but it has also been proven to renew the effectiveness of traditional ones in 2018. The remarkable resurgence of billboard advertising has been driven to a large extent by the fact that the channel has â€˜progressed to the point where advertisers can now track nearly all of the same metrics with a billboard as they can with a digital adâ€™. Itâ€™s a fascinating story of how data and measurement have resurrected a â€˜relic of the pastâ€™ and opened up exciting opportunities for marketers.Nailing down data ethicsThe advent of the GDPR legislation within the European Economic Area (EEA), as well as the fallout from events such as Cambridge Analytica, have had profound effects.Notably, in May, Google pulled access rights to user-level data within the EEA, preventing marketers from collecting this information for cross-channel measurement and attribution of Display advertising. Google represents 44% of global advertising spend according to Forresterâ€™s October Privacy report and analysts are expecting this new policy to extend globally by the end of 2019. Forresterâ€™s assessment is astonishingly frank, making it impossible to â€œuse independent attribution models for precise, granular-level measurementâ€.The data privacy changes have certainly resulted in another false start for 360 degree attribution but we have observed an overall positive mentality shift as a result. The new limitations in access to 3rd party data has forced marketers to look inwards, at their 1st party data and for most, there is a treasure trove of future IP and competitive advantage to unlock in the data their brands own. To do that, 2019 has to be the year where marketing starts to commit to breaking down the silos, with unified 1st party data now the foundation for not only better measurement and attribution but also GDPR compliance and data science more broadly.New perspectives on measurementThe GDPR and data management challenges have also contributed to changing goals for marketers. Brand awareness has climbed to become the number one priority for marketers, overtaking customer lifetime value (CLTV). Whilst the potential impact on business of optimising CLTV is still highly regarded, itâ€™s deprioritised because the data silo problem makes it extremely difficult to measure, let alone optimise.We frequently hear complaints about the lack of effective tools to quantify the impact of different marketing strategies on CLTV. Whilst we knew the industry still had progress to make here, we were taken aback by the lack of progress revealed by some recent survey results. This month, ClickZ research showed us that only 33% of marketers believe that their measurement tools are accurately delivering accurate attribution across all channels. An even fewer 9% have confidence that their company as a whole has an â€œexcellentâ€ understanding of multi-touch attribution across the lifecycle of a customer.We predict that in 2019, marketers will stop looking at metrics and KPIs in silos too. Whereas in the past, weâ€™ve seen huge swings in sentiment (and spend) from brand marketing to direct response, marketers can now expect their measurement partners to help them understand and optimise the drivers of success at every level, from acquisition to CLTV and the role brand plays in driving both.Customer care will come firstIn 2018, customer acquisition costs (CAC) rose again, driving an increase of almost 50%over the past five years, according to Hubspot research. It is now costing on average five times more to acquire a new customer than it is to retain an existing customer.In this context, we hope to see a move away from the short-term strategies that deliver fast ROI at the expense of long term customer health. We predict that retaining and nurturing existing customers will become more of a business priority for all, backed by the opportunity in the data to get a more granular and complete understanding of the customer and the consequences of marketing activities on them.Certainly, with Amazon continuing its global domination in 2018, built on AI and its principle to â€˜start with the customer and work backwardsâ€™, there is a good precedent here!More businesses empowered to build better business cases39% of respondents ranked proving ROI as their biggest challenge for 2019. Interestingly, this was closely followed by 27% telling us they feared not getting enough capital for their budgets. Clearly, marketers are still not able to objectively prove the effectiveness of either specific channels or their broader strategy.Weâ€™ve written about the opportunity in marketing measurement and attribution that data science is opening up, from identifying channels underrepresented by out-of-the-box attribution models in Google Analytics to drilling into channels that are traditionally overvalued. It appears from the Hubspot survey that itâ€™s also becoming a business imperative. CFOs and CEOs are expecting CMOs to be a revenue-driving functionâ€¦ and be able to communicate through the data how they are going to drive it.Integrating data specialism into your teamsData is fast becoming the basis for all competitive advantage in marketing and itâ€™s critically important that we organise our teams in the same way. It is no longer sensible or even possible to segregate data specialists and traditional marketers. Companies must sponsor communication and continual learning between both groups. It is not necessary for marketers to have all these data skills but it is crucial to understand their importance and application.

There was just something about reinventing or transforming everyday processes. If idea generation were a singular job, I would be world renowned! I kid, but really who doesnâ€™t love coming up with new ideas? It truly is a rush for me and has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my career.But little did I know that would not be the norm for my career. Rather, the norm would be traversing from current to future state in a transformative way â€” or, in other words, disruption.Disrupt. Disruption. Disruptor. The use of these words has become so common we often dismiss the concept of what it means and how to sustainably operate as a disruptor.When I first became a manager, I was asked to rotate into a new role to â€œdisruptâ€ the status quo. I jumped in full of energy, excitement and ideas (think Chihuahua, whereâ€™s the ball?).What I missed was that my new managerâ€™s version of disruption and mine were light years apart. He wanted subtle shifts that wouldnâ€™t really cause ripples within the organization while I envisioned changing not only my team, but the way the entire organization worked. I love these moments when a realization FINALLY happens, and itâ€™s not on day one or even day 60, when you realize there is a disconnect. I learned something critical from that experience, a new lesson â€” there is a difference between â€œbig Dâ€ disruption and â€œlittle dâ€ disruption.Little â€œdâ€ disruptions are those small tweaks you make along the way. For example, we want to work differently, weâ€™re going to move the coffee pot to the other side of the kitchen. Big â€œdâ€ disruption is blowing up the entire organization with the way youâ€™re working. Instead of moving the coffee pot, letâ€™s move the entire kitchen and, oh yeah, letâ€™s bring in an espresso machine.When I entered that new role, I was envisioning big d, my manager â€” little d. We were using the same words and same language, yet we had a very different tolerance for the impacts and shifts.So how do you ensure there isnâ€™t a disconnect when youâ€™re joining an organization or starting a new role? How do you move forward to successfully impart sustainable change?In grade school, we learned about the â€œFive Ws.â€ When youâ€™re looking to disrupt, itâ€™s a great time to ask those questions â€” who, what, where, when, why and the occasional how. If youâ€™re asked to come in and disrupt, take the time to ask yourself five simple questions before you accept the position. Ask what does success look like? What is the tolerance for risk? Who is not going to be on board and what influence do they have? Why does your manager believe you can be the one to disrupt? By taking a time out and reflecting rather than letting the â€œdisruptorâ€ label get you excited, you can help ensure you have alignment and transparency rather than disappointment.Disruption is hard, it takes patience and energy. It is often a two-step forward, one step back process. Many times, the tendency is to come in like a bull in a china shop. Unless there is a serious turnaround situation, my advice is to come in to an organization and spend the first 30â€“60 days asking questions and learning. Learning why things are done the way they are, who are the influencers, who will be on board with change and just as important â€” who will not. I often say: to change the game, you must play the game. It is critically important to not just sit on the sidelines and judge the ways of work, but rather join in and get some small wins. You might truly be surprised at the results.Building credibility is like building up your bank account, every small win or new relationship is a deposit into your account. When you walk into an organization or start a new role, you should work to build capital (leverage) in your bank account. Whenever youâ€™re ready to make a withdrawal, take an action or make a change, ask yourself: do I have enough capital to spend? Too often weâ€™re too swift or donâ€™t have the patience required to make sustainable, disruptive change. In my experience, it is often more effective with one methodical shift after another leading to an end goal.I learned something critical from that experience, a new lesson â€” there is a difference between â€œbig Dâ€ disruption and â€œlittle dâ€ disruption.Once youâ€™ve built up enough capital (leverage) after making deposits into your bank account, youâ€™re ready to withdraw (make a change). This is easier said than done. As with any substantial purchase, consider whether the item or change is worth it. Do you have enough capital to spend on the change you want to effect, or are you trying to borrow against credit that you donâ€™t have? Not all change is created equally and not every change is worth it.Weâ€™ve all heard the saying that â€œthere is no I in TEAM.â€ This is true for disruptors. No one wants to work with someone they believe is solely focused on their own ideas and unwilling to be a team player. A focus on the greater good of the team will always pay off in the end.At FedEx, we have a cultural concept called gravity. Gravity asks us to consider which issues we can control or influence. If there is an issue outside of our sphere of control or influence, itâ€™s a gravity issue and we likely cannot change it, nor should we focus our energy on trying to change it.Organizational behavior and processes carry a lot of gravity as they are often ingrained in the culture. Understanding the weight of the disruption you believe is possible is like looking at the mountain before you climb it. You can see some of it, but there are layers that will only expose themselves when directly traversed. Before you begin disrupting, be sure to consider whether the change youâ€™re attempting to make has gravity.When youâ€™re ready to cause some disruption, be ready for the setbacks and remember that you are a part of a larger team. Amazing results far larger than you likely imagined can be possible by considering the steps above.And before you decide to walk out the door or lose your passion for change after so many â€œdefeats,â€ ask yourself if itâ€™s you or the organization that is making disruption harder? You just might find itâ€™s a combination of both.----Technologist, digital, software architecture junkie, Memphian and occasional disruptor.

In order for your business to be located in such a competitive sector, you need to know the latest trends and updates.The key is to change the approach and keep up to date with key trends in web design and development. It is important to work with a reliable web application development company to implement web design and development trends to gain a competitive advantage.It is also important to set priorities and understand the business objectives, assess the technical skills of staff and analyze the preferences of potential users.As a web development company, you will find not only important web technologies but will help you create a website worthy of attention. After careful brainstorming, we present here some top trends in website development for 2019 and 2020, as they come before us.Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to simulate human information and to perform cognitive functions such as the ability to learn, collect data, analyze information, understand emotions or solve difficult problems. The need for AI solutions, multiple automation and communication will be more common this year.Emerging technologies like Virtual Assistant (VA), Chat Bots and Voice Bots have changed the face of social media and have helped improve businesses. Their evolution for their virtual client enabled assistants such as Alexa by Amazon, Siri from Apple and Cortana by Microsoft will definitely transform the entire industry.2. Blockchain TechnologyThese days, many websites set up payment gateways to carry out monetary transactions. Well, the blockchain is the future of financial transactions. It will help you improve transparency and reduce financial costs. With the growing demand for cryptocurrency, the development of bitcoin is also important. The future of monetary transactions is expected to be cryptocurrency.Blockchain technology provides greater security for online transactions. It does not need an intermediary to execute the transactions. This technology uses standard data storage to allow users to store data in different parts of the globe. The Blockchain makes it easier for financial institutions and banks to maintain data to customers securely in the form of algorithms.3. Push NotificationsLike mobile apps, websites can target many audiences by using push notification services. In addition, you can also take advantage of push notification for the marketing of your website or products.Push notifications are essential services to attract the attention of customers and website visitors. But make sure itâ€™s not too much, you have to avoid too many. Push notifications allow us to share helpful activities, attractive discounts and much more directly to the customers.4. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)We all know that users are becoming more and more impatient. A website that makes them wait is not what they are looking for. Google also likes AMP. Accelerated mobile pages are in demand, as website users love reduced loading time of pages they are browsing. So, the best part is to keep Google and customers satisfied with the speed of the website.5. The RAIL ConceptThe Response Animation Idle Load (RAIL) is highly predicted to be in demand for the near future. The idea is that the website loading time will be much faster (less than the second) and that the website will function exceptionally well.RAIL divides the UX into performance by dragging, tapping, scrolling and so on. In summary, the RAIL theory is advantageous for a web designer, who can operate with a solid structure for user-oriented performance. Its main concern is the comfortable and pleasant experience of the user.6. Motion UIUsers of this era require everything that is easy to use and understandable. Select a Motion UI with a minimalist website using a practical and aesthetic interface. All web design product must be interactive and attractive to capture the attention of interested users. The motion interface could be a new Web improvement to maintain the attractiveness of your brand.They are able to keep their customersâ€™ attention better than traditional web design projects. The problem is that extensive research and rigorous executions are required to successfully increase the websiteâ€™s conversion rate. The Motion user interface includes desktop designs, animated graphics, headers, and hovers. Your website will soon be fantastic using a Motion UI.It can be a sophisticated technology; therefore, it is necessary to ask for support to the top web development trends of the company to offer a fluid and pleasant customer experience.7. Internet of Things (IoT)According to Statistaâ€™s research, there will be around 31 million devices in 2020. This increase in the number of IoT devices or gadgets could have a strong impact on the Web development process.This is because businesses tend to regulate the unit through a laptop or desktop. If you want to become familiar with its products and improve customer solutions or its global services, you need to use a device with the website.8. Single Page ApplicationA one-page application or single page application (SPA) is a web-based application corresponding to unwanted navigation actions developed to obtain HTML interruption due to reloading the page and reducing the period of Web development with useful JavaScript useful among user devices. It improves performance and reduces the host side.This is an excellent option when creating responsive websites, encouraging mobile apps, tablets, and desktop applications. The latest improvements to the SPA are based on the React and Angular frameworks, which ensure that it is convenient and adapted for hybrid applications.9. IT or Cyber SecurityThe fact that statistical violations, cyber-dangers, software piracy, and data theft are among the terrible threats that fall under the scope of scientific development and technological progress, means that 2020 will not be an exemption.Cybersecurity will not be wiped out soon. IT or cybersecurity can be used for security systems against theft, service interruption or management errors, as well as hardware, applications or damage to electronic data.IT security professionals understand that cybercriminals will not stop looking for victims and look for vulnerabilities. To this end, industries, companies, communities, and individuals must strengthen their security systems to obtain databases, servers and their information. Therefore, deep solutions are needed to address global IT challenges.ConclusionIt is essential that professional web developers understand future trends in web application design and development. This helps them enable their customers to build and maintain long-lasting relationships with their customers.

The technological artifacts or concepts are coined at a particular time, by a specific group of people or a person. A term is specified to explain its usage and functions. This is then subjected to various discourses. If the inventors getto name and address a form of technology, should it be expressed the same everywhere? Why is there a lack in the literature to address digital technology?Certain cultures have already coined their technological terminologies. For example, at the University of Iceland (1964) they called their first computer tÃ¶lva which was a combination of two Icelandic terms tala which meant number and vÃ¶lva that meant prophetess that created a poetic phrase â€˜Prophetess of numbersâ€™. Another great example in the Indian context is how Tamil culture embraces technology, translating and coining their terms for every artifact, including the word â€˜technologyâ€™ which is Toá¸»ilnuá¹­pam. This goes to show that technology can fluidly be adopted and inculcated into cultures, so why do we still experience this gap?A computer has been known as a ticket vending machine in a remote village of Andhra Pradesh, where people do not see its form or any of its components which gives out its name. The only thing visible is a monitor that is being used for interaction and a small printer outlet to collect the ticket. There are similar examples that have shown a deviation in usage and naming of technology with respect to how it was initially intended to be addressed by the innovators. When it comes to language, throughout time, explorations within oneâ€™s own language have been reduced and adaptation from other languages has been seen to increase. The work on literature to express technology or lifestyle has been also hindered along the way. A chair in English is known as â€˜Kursiâ€™ in Hindi and â€˜Kurchiâ€™ in Telugu. From objects to names of jobs and political positions, all of them have been explored and termed by different names in different languages as and when people experienced them. On the other hand, Digital Technology seems to create its own language which people started exploring, more than any other language. The other aspect of it is understanding what led to the adaptation of new terminologies in different languages.One of the factors which were identified is the origin and usage of an object/artifact in multiple geographical locations. For example, letâ€™s consider medicine. Throughout the world, people faced problems related to health and illness. A need emerged to solve this problem. Peoplestarted discovering their own cures for different diseases. Medicine became subject to study.The languages of these different locations conceptualized a name and meaning for medicine, â€˜Davaâ€™ in Hindi and â€˜Vaidyamâ€™ in Telugu etc.Another way to look at it is certain objects were attached to daily life and daily need of the people who obtained their terms in different languages. For example, A very specific variant in footwear like Slippers which was used widely by masses on a daily basis was named â€˜Chappalâ€™ inHindi and â€˜Cheppuluâ€™ in Telugu.Now, if a computer is so widely used everywhere why does it not have a name in different languages?To answer this letâ€™s take a revolution before the digital revolution, the industrial revolution. It started in Britan around the 18th century (https://www.britannica.com/event/Industrial-Revolution) and later different parts of the world identified and adapted it. They identified theprocesses and terminologies and came up with terms for different elements involved in it. For example, a factory was termed as â€˜Karkhanaâ€™ in Hindi and â€˜Parisramaâ€™ in Telugu. The other elements associated with industries also acquired their names along with it. In Telugu, raw materials are called as â€˜Mudi Sarukuâ€™, labour is known as â€˜Karmikuluâ€™, production is known as â€˜Utpattiâ€™ and godowns are known as â€˜Giddanguluâ€™.As we can see within two centuries and its usage in various locations apart from the location of origin has brought in different terminologies to address this technology and elements around it, maybe digital technology might also follow the same. Although a computer was coined long back the rise of the whole digital era is very recent, which is the last 3 decades. A fair chance can be we can see a similar pattern in digital technology. On the other hand in a few countries where people are considering English to be a superior language,and addition in literature around their own native language is reducing, these kinds of explorations may not be visible. All we might see in a later phase is a rough translation of the meaning or the concept related to the technology.To counter this, it is important to teach the younger generations these native languages in a more a contextual and relevant manner which includes an understanding of language that is based around digital technology.Can the literature include content to comprehend digital technology in a new way? Can the language reflect the technology in the context of use to the area it is spoken or written in? Can language and various discourses around it rephrase technological concepts or products? Can technology be re-conceptualized and termed through time using different words to express itself better?Maybe not at a synchronous pace but a few languages like Tamil try to understand and make terms and meanings for the innovations. If sources of knowledge like news, fictional and non-fictional books, texts and articles include conceptualizing and usage of technology to makepeople aware of it across various linguistic boundaries, we can see a larger spectrum of its capabilities and evolution.If digital technology was to be made available to comprehend in different languages, we would see two-way learning and growth. The context, capabilities, and functions of digital technology can be understood by many people including people across remote areas and villages. This canhelp them to look at digital technology through the lens of their problems or wishes, and help the technology to evolve and solve a larger set of problems as well.This year, Google has launched an app called â€˜Boloâ€™ that is free and helps children in rural India learn how to read. This is an assistive technology that provides positive and corrective feedback to children using it. It tracks progress and uses a gamified experience that is fun and helps createa habit to use the application. If this kind of concept could be made available to the general population which is focused on learning technology through native languages, it could change the way we see and speak about digital technology.To maintain such a system that addresses digital technology, a proper structure and organizations need to be set in place to ensure this is a constant evolution process that reaches the right audience. Writers publishing work related to this context should be acknowledged and supported.This would increase the reach and awareness of technology across various linguistic and economic boundaries.----History of Human & DigitalAmala Mukundadas--Vipul NegiinHistory of Human & Digital--Ashwin Kurian WilsoninHistory of Human & Digital--1Naveen BagalkotinHistory of Human & Digital--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Scott H.

Fewer details travelling across the ether means fewer opportunities for error or abuse. A game changer for all concernedâ€¦but it shouldnâ€™t stop there.This security feature is part of a wider conversation that Banked wants to have about money, that aims to put the consumer back at the heart of open banking. We want to create a world that enables developers and business owners to make products that allow money actions to be seamlessly integrated into everyday experiences, hyper specific to an individualâ€™s needs and situation. We hope that this will be a collaborative journey where the ones that rise to the top will be those obsessed with the customer, their privacy, and their unique demands in a digital world. This is the world in which Banked operates and is building the blocks for; an ecosystem with new rules and new players.What does this mean?Put simply, this means more control over what financial data is shared, with whom, and how it is used. This in turn enables businesses working outside of financial services to access and offer money experiences to their customers, creating personalised solutions for everyone, at the point of transaction. People donâ€™t need more choice, they needed more personalisation, available in the moment. And increasingly, they are turning to trusted brands outside of banking to create these experiences for them.Banks vs Banking : Change banking habits, not your bankBanks have traditionally been the gatekeepers of money and money services. This new ecosystem levels the playing field, allows any regulated business to offer access to money services away from traditional banks, directly where the consumer needs them. Whilst allowing the individual to keep their money where theyâ€™re most comfortable, in the bank.As an FCA regulated company, Banked can take the pressure away from new players wanting to provide innovative money experiences to end users. This allows them to build more creatively, safe in the knowledge that they are protected by us, their trusted partner, from the risks involved in using financial data.Weâ€™re bank agnostic. Weâ€™re connected to all the major banks in the UK and are regulated by the FCA. Banked is currently the only smart payment solution that combines the cheapest, fastest, and most secure processes available on the market; with a vested interest in the experience of the individual, enabling brands to deliver a product with the consumer at its core.Bankedâ€™s first step on this journey to put the consumer back in the centre is with payments. Simple, secure, customisable; the Banked Payment API is the best way to add payment capabilities into your website, service, or app. Because the user pays directly from a bank account, the product owner doesnâ€™t have to hold any sensitive card details and everyone is fully protected. And we enable all this at a low cost per transaction.Our developer portal provides our community with the tools and rich data to build premium products and experiences. This means that consumers can expect more tailored money solutions based on their own financial actions, whilst keeping control of their financial data.Our roadmap shows our ambition over the coming weeks and months to extend our product lines and includes giving public access to our developer portal, extended payment analytics functions, and the Banked App â€” a consumer facing money platform. We have a transparent pricing structure and a number of incentives outlined that will ensure product managers and developers can benefit from helping us build a community of makers and transform the future of banking.We want to talk to everyone, from start-ups to enterprises.

The main courses include, but are not limited to, Taiwanese sausage with sticky rice, grilled squid, deep-fried chicken cutlets, salt chicken, and braised pork knuckle. Last but not least, desserts are grass jelly, mochi, mango shaved ice, snowflake ice, and adzuki bean with milk ice.Donâ€™t get me wrong, these foods were consumed by the KuCoin delegation attending the Asia Blockchain Summit 2019 â€” there were four of us.I still remember last time when I traveled around this beautiful island alone, and I had to choose no more than two options (three at most) from dozens of tasty foods every dinner. Too bad I am not a food fighter. So frustrating.But not this time!We shared so that we could all try the various delicacies, so there was absolutely no need to make tough choices, just like the staking solution KuCoinâ€™s new product line Soft Staking offers.Fine, this is another hard-sell advertisement. However, itâ€™s one that offers a pretty decent investment return, with quite loose terms. Let me elaborate.In my last Staking piece posted on May 31, we discussed the major feature of Staking â€” very much similar to the fixed-income asset in the traditional financial world.â€œFixedâ€ is the keyword here: a) the investor is not supposed to move the asset from where itâ€™s kept in custody; b) the investor will be paid a pre-determined interest income; c) for a pre-decided period of time.Most of the current Staking schemes are not much different from that. Pretty tough terms, huh?Thatâ€™s why we tried to soften it: a) users can withdraw their tokens stored in the Soft Staking scheme whenever they choose to; b) they can still get the interest income on a daily basis; c) no minimum staking period, so users can make the deposit today and withdraw the tokens tomorrow.With that, usersâ€™ demand of trading for capital gain and staking for dividend are perfectly taken care of.Now you might wonder, with such generous terms on withdrawal, what interest rate could it possibly offer? A demand deposit account holder is offered 0.35% of the annualized rate in China, for your reference.Well, some projects in our Soft Staking Program are able to offer 6% to 12% of the annualized return rate, while Poloniex offers 3% to 10% return rate within a similar package.But wait, some might find the 6%-12% ROI not satisfying enough, and still aim at potential capital gain by trading their tokens when the market revives, just like our CEO Michael said at the Asia Blockchain Summit 2019 in Taipei:â€œThe reason that Staking is so popular, I think, is partly because in a rather bearish market, the investment options for users are limited. Frankly, I donâ€™t know for how long this momentum would last.â€True, itâ€™s very hard to hold up to a play-safe and risk-averse appetite, especially in the recent market recovery.Thus, when users find themselves in the mood for trading, the anytime-withdrawal service that Soft Staking offers gives them a chance to make some gains between fluctuations â€” or, maybe the chance to learn an expensive lesson. Lol. Sorry.Despite the slight uncertainty about the future of the Staking economy, Michael is (as we all are) affirmatively optimistic on the influence of this model from a profound perspective:â€œInnovation, no matter in technology or business model, are always helpful to attract more attention to the crypto world from the outside, and that will ultimately lead to fundamental improvement. We might see killer blockchain applications sooner than we expected.â€In this sense, I see every reason for us to make this innovation based on the Staking economy. And there is genuine demand from the market that we should make no hesitation to cater to.Plus, as I mentioned in my last Staking-related post, when we escrow our tokens to others, individual or institution, we want someone trustworthy in terms of both morality and security technology. Dealing with hundreds of millions of dollars worth assets every day, I cannot think of a more secured staking pool than an exchange.Therefore, the tokens are in good hands. You can enjoy a stable dividend income, while still having the liberty to take them out anytime.So yes, you can have your cake and eat it too. Isnâ€™t it a thoughtful product we offer?----1kucoinexchangeKuCoin Co-founder & VP, doubles the partner of KuCoinâ€™s investment affiliate Phoenix Global Capital, blockchain frontrunner, investor and advisor.Johnny Lyuinkucoinexchange--2KuCoin Academyinkucoinexchange--KuCoin Officialinkucoinexchange--1Johnny Lyuinkucoinexchange--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Unbecoming--764Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--121Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Libra is a cryptocurrency in development by Facebook that will come with its very own blockchain. But Libra is very different from bitcoin for multiple reasons in several different areas. Letâ€™s take a closer look at them here.Libra, unlike bitcoin, is meant to be the worldâ€™s first truly digital currency. Where Libraâ€™s financial backing makes it a more stable digital currency, bitcoin is prone to high risks and scarcity (which gives it its value). Bitcoin also needs to be mined and is still not a widespread form of online transactions; whereas Libra can be bought and will follow global currency standards.So, while Libra is in effect a cryptocurrency, it fundamentally differs from bitcoin, and its need to exist on a blockchain is questionable at best.The project is backed by Facebookâ€™s Libra Association, a collection of big companies tied to the project that give real-world value to Libra. Some of these names include Visa, Mastercard, eBay, PayPal, Spotify, Uber, Lyft, and Union Square Ventures, to give you just a sneak peek. And with some of these companies paying a whopping $10 million as a joining fee, Libra certainly has strong financial backing.With the value being guaranteed by real assets, it is a lot less risky to invest in than other cryptocurrencies. Facebook also has a new subsidiary called Calibra, which will contain the digital wallet and plugins for Libra. Facebook is looking to create a voting board of at least 100 financial contributors in the Libra Association and run the venture as a not-for-profit organization. Facebook will get one vote as itself and one vote as Calibra as part of the governing body.According to Facebook, Libra is targeted at the developing world and parts of the world with limited bank access. What Libra is meant to do is to level the playing field so that low-income individuals can have access to financial assets without needing to pay costly fees for financial services. All someone needs to use Libra is a smartphone or computer and access to the internet. While parts of the globe still donâ€™t have these resources, it is estimated that over five billion of the worldâ€™s seven billion population do have them.Libra will work like any other cryptocurrency, being monitored by nodes on its blockchain, facilitating peer to peer transactions, and removing the need for financial transaction fees that are charged by banks and other financial companies. If Libra can marry the stability of real-world currency with the freedom of cryptocurrency, the system could very well find plenty of takers.The launch of Libra in 2020 could also mean a big upsurge in engagement with other cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects. While they are already finding more widespread use, the concept is still quite alien to most internet users. Libra could open up new avenues in this respect because it appears to be a safe and reliable way to engage with an emerging technology.----DRIVE InsiderEditor at DRIVE Insider.

Iâ€™ve always had a passion for real estate and decided that if I am to continue playing in this sandbox, I needed to take a long-term view of what I wanted my career to look like and reverse-engineer from there.I am now working within â€œPropTechâ€ â€” a term generally associated with any company/organisation that is leveraging the power of technology to eradicate the inefficiencies within the real estate industry.The decision to go down this route wasnâ€™t a random one and was in fact quite calculated, which is why I turned down the opportunities I had to go back into estate agency.Although nothing is guaranteed, there is incredibly strong evidence to highlight that money, time & attention are being diverted away from traditionally structured real estate/property related businesses towards firms manipulating technology to add real & measurable value to the client and consumer experience.From a long-term career perspective, I felt now was the time to move into a sector which is primed to have significantly more growth potential than traditional service based property companies within the space.A potential downside of this move is having to face stagnated income growth and seniority in the short term, this is caveated however by the realistic prospects of earning significantly more in the near future. Short term pain. Long term gain.Iâ€™m a firm believer that performing to the best of your ability at a company that you have real belief in rarely yields poor results, which in turn will lead to increased seniority and income eventually. Being naturally impatient and in a rush to â€œMake Itâ€, I found it hard to adopt this approach, but I am fully embracing the â€œItâ€™s a marathon not a sprintâ€ ideology as time progresses.When making this decision I mapped out (to the best of my ability) both a career path in estate agency/brokerage and a career path in PropTech and measured each path against a number of metrics; including learning potential, earning potential, industry robustness, work satisfaction, working environment & work peers. Based on these measures, it became evident that a move away from estate agency was what suited my long-term vision of where I wanted to be.Despite the frustration and discomfort of leaving a vertical I was very comfortable and knowledgable in, I know that the decision I have made falls in line with what I place value on in my career. If I could speak to my younger self, I would advise him to really take the time to think about what he views as most valuable and begin to define what success means to him; then ensure all actions are diverted towards fulfilling that definition.----Thoughts on thingsTopsy Taiwo--Topsy Taiwo--Topsy Taiwo--Topsy Taiwo--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Does biology really determine morality? Can we enhance our morality through biotechnologies? And if so, how would such technologies relate to traditional sources of moral formation like religious belief and practice?Dr Harris Wiseman examines the philosophy, biology, psychology and theology of moral bioenhancement in his book The Myth of the Moral Brain: the Limits of Moral Enhancement, and kindly agreed to be interviewed in January 2019.This interview covers the relationship between moral enhancement technology and religion, churchesâ€™ use of emerging technologies, and whether public theology would be usefully directed towards moral enhancement technology.To hear about future interviews or other blog posts, follow Subtle Engine on Twitter or sign up for emails using the form at the bottom of this page.Q Could you briefly introduce your aims and research on moral enhancement?When I first came to engage with moral bioenhancement discourse, I have to say that I found the enthusiasm in the discourse to be very fantastical indeed. It seemed like moral bioenhancement had the potential to touch on some very important issues, and so my hope was to bring the discourse back to planet earth. I wanted to give moral enhancement a bottom-up foundation.That is, when we think about moral bioenhancement we should start by taking account of concrete facts on the ground, rather than starting with abstract speculations. A lot of the proposals for moral bioenhancement that had been suggested were quite cockamamy. When confronted with any of the real-world logistical issues that it would take to put them into practice they quickly fell to pieces (see my 2018 chapter The Sins of Moral Enhancement Discourse for a detailed account of these problems). Such proposals have no real grounding in actual reality, and seemed to be little more than flights of fantasy.This is really problematic because there are real evils in the world right now that need to be tackled in concrete and meaningful ways. Thatâ€™s not going to be easy. Armchair speculation about neuro-enhancement to make people more compassionate is cheap, and potentially quite offensive when stacked against the hard-won efforts put in by the real people, making real sacrifices, in the real world right now. Indeed, presenting unrealistic fantasies as solutions for real evil and suffering (which is exactly what many enthusiasts in the discourse had done) demeans the hard efforts of people tackling these issues now, often at great cost to themselves.Above all, I wanted to correct the false belief that moral living is something that can be understood primarily in biological terms. One has to be careful here, this point is easily misunderstood. We are biological beings, of course. Our moral activity is inevitably mediated by that biology. But, we are also beings with psychology, we are social beings, we are beings with a history and culture, and so much more.It is every bit as crude â€” and false, in fact â€” to believe that humans can be reduced to psychological motivations, or to say â€˜we are just the product of our environmentâ€™, as it is to say that morality can be understood primarily in biological terms. Importantly, it is just as wrong to think of these factors as if they are wholly discrete layers on a cake. Our biology impacts our psychology, our psychology impacts our biology, and so on with all the various dimensions of our lives and the relationships we have. There is a dynamic set of mutually influencing interactions going on, and to just isolate biology as if that were â€˜the main thingâ€™, and all our hopes could be put in manipulating this biology demonstrates a very poor understanding of the kind of creatures human beings actually are.There may be some ways in which biology can be leveraged in this regard (I propose a number in The Myth of the Moral Brain, for example in treating addiction and alcoholism), but these will always be limited prospects. Moral bioenhancement can never be any kind of salvatory hope, because the relationship between morality and biology is nowhere near as tight as such salvatory hopes would need them to be.Q Do you think of The Myth of the Moral Brain as a theological contribution to moral enhancement or more a recognition that itâ€™s simply impossible to ignore religion in attempts to enhance morality?I was surprised to see the extent to which religion had been ignored in the discourse. In that sense, it is not at all that religion is impossible to ignore â€” to the contrary, it is all too easy to ignore religion, and very tempting to do so, because religion adds such an immense amount of complexity to the discourse. Grappling with that complexity requires a concerted effort, and itâ€™s hard to know where to begin. There are a lot of religious persons on earth (5.8 out of the nearly 8 billion). These religious persons are extremely differentiated with respect to what they believe, where their moral boundaries lie, and how willing they are to embrace technologies that would potentially alter parts of their identities considered by some to be sacrosanct. Moreover, this landscape is constantly changing, and differs from national region to region.If one is to enhance people, one must know the very people that are to be enhanced. Yet, religiosity, one of the core founding stones of personsâ€™ moral values and sense of the good, is completely severed from the discourse. These real world, ground-level realities, religious and cultural differences, and the diversity in moral intuitions (i.e., what actually makes for â€˜the goodâ€™, and which version of â€˜the goodâ€™ is to be enhanced), have to be accounted for in any presentation of moral enhancement that wants to be at all practicable or realistic. Religion is an unassailable part of the conceptual, moral, social and behavioural landscape of any country (before one even begins to think of cross-cultural engagement on these matters), and absolutely should not be ignored. Some extensive transnational sociological analysis of religious attitudes towards technology and enhancing morality is very much required.Next, in terms of theology, I was not so much trying to devise a specific â€˜theology of moral enhancementâ€™ per se, as I was attempting to apply existing pastoral theology as a reflective device to gain insight into the processes involved in religious moral formation. Looking at the pastoral insights into how moral values are in reality taken up by persons and embodied in individuals and groups, one finds a picture that is rich, layered and integrative. There is no sense that moral formation is something purely intellectual, or purely about pleasant sentiments, or just about building good habits. Rather, becoming good is more about the formation of the whole person within an overarching salvatory conceptual structure, wherein moral learning is done through modelling, mentors, imitation and improvisation, it is enacted as much in groups as in private, and requires the reshaping of values and motivations â€” every part of the person is changed.That is really what hammered home the superficiality of the moral enhancement enthusiasm I was reading. It is not until one gets a really sharp look at how integral, organic and holistic the processes involved in moral growth are that one really comes to grasp how shallow are the proposed moral bioenhancement interventions, and how exaggerated are the expectations of the technological enhancement of morality. How can slapping a magnetic stimulator to the side of oneâ€™s head, or taking a dose of propranolol, or any such thing of that order possibly compare to the organic and synergistic quality of how morality is actually taken up and enacted in real life?Q The Church has used objects (from beads to icons to architecture) to aid behaviour change for years. Now there are more sophisticated and perhaps less transparent efforts: bible apps that reward reading, Alexa skills that encourage prayer etc. Are churches equipped to critically assess new technologies?Iâ€™m not sure churches need any kind of special expertise to be able to critically assess the technology they use â€” a little common sense and practical wisdom should be sufficient.I would suggest that the most powerful advances offered by technology are in terms of communication, inasmuch as religious communities and individuals, who were once disparate, can now share information, thoughts, ideas, hopes, fear, and organise events in ways never before seen. That is the real stuff technology is offering in terms of moral â€˜enhancementâ€™ â€” the ability to do good en masse is heavily dependent on oneâ€™s ability to communicate (and much the same is true of the ability to organise evil). So, communication technology offers the ability to easily connect with persons that were unreachable, to get important news information from danger zones, to bring to light human suffering; and it provides the opportunity to better organise groups for the creation of public goods (everything from community outreach, to sending aid and assistance when tidal waves strike).It is these more simple and obvious opportunities facilitated by new technology that have the most potential for â€˜enhancingâ€™ the spread of good in our world. These are the more down-to-earth prospects I tend to prefer, as they keep the human element in focus instead of getting lost in hopes for magic bullets created by fantastical speculations. But, such things are not really what â€˜moral bioenhancementâ€™ enthusiasts have in mind, which seems to be more in line with fancy gadgets, apps, pharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence, neurosurgery, and wearable tech to remind everyone to be nice and kind. I suggest that is looking in the wrong direction.With respect to the sort of advance you mention, apps for bible reading and so forth, certainly they can be valuable, but they are hardly earth-shattering. In a way, such advances must be applied, because the younger generation is used to engaging with things through such media. If the church does not provide apps and such conveniences it is going to be completely unable to engage with a whole generation of persons growing into an increasingly secularised, and pervasively online world. Even so, as â€˜enhancementsâ€™, these sorts of advances are helpful if used appropriately, as long as one understands that they donâ€™t really change anything fundamental (and, personally, I still prefer my prayer beads).The main point is that one has to be already making efforts in the right direction. Such apps and aids provide helpful conveniences which make it easier to do what one was already trying to do. Rewarding reading the Bible with tokens, like one is playing a computer game; or sending round reminder e-mails: â€˜have you said your prayers today?â€™ are not going to change anyoneâ€™s life. A pre-existing will is always required to move things forwards, combined, ideally, with good company and worthy social scaffolding. Even then, moral growth is still hard enough. Nudges, rewards and tricks may have short-term benefits in terms of encouraging certain behaviours. But, the fundamental problem is the same now as it always has been: it is the problem of the will, and motivating oneself to keep carrying on along this long, hard road of authentic moral growth. In the face of that, Alexa skills for praying are not going to cut it.Q Would you like to see more accessible public theology on moral enhancement technology â€” what value might this bring to secular society?For me, the biggest value that comes from theological reflection on moral enhancement is that it serves as a mirror in which we can look at ourselves and examine our intuitions about what makes us human, and how we should live our lives â€” what goodness really means to us, and how it relates to practising our faith. Public theology, to that end, would be valuable. It would really help to get people talking about what it is to be a good person, what gets in the way of being good, and about why we constantly seem to think that biology holds all the answers to our character. We should definitely be thinking about how fully embodied moral living is â€” it is not something just we think about, nor just something we feel, but it is in everything we do.In terms of public theological engagement, moral enhancement comes back to the good old philosophical question (which is perhaps the only real philosophical question that matters), that is: what makes for a good and worthwhile life? In relation to that, moral enhancement issues encourage us to ask: how does technology fit into the moral life? Why be moral at all, what is the value of being moral? Who gets to decide what is and is not moral? If there were ways of making everybody good, why shouldnâ€™t we apply them? All these things are great to talk about, and I would encourage this at all levels, from school all the way up. From my conversations with teachers who have raised these sorts of questions in class, such ideas seem to be intrinsically interesting and exciting. For me, if weâ€™re talking about public engagement, this is the beating heart of moral enhancement discourse and why it is really worth talking about.Though I began thinking about moral bioenhancement as something that needed to be brought to earth, ironically, its primary theological value is as a thought experiment, and as an exploratory tool. What moral bioenhancement absolutely is not, though, is something that needs immediate, urgent preparatory discussion. So, if you mean that public theology should engage with moral enhancement questions, as if to say: â€˜we must get out ahead of this thing, and confront this problem before it gets to usâ€™, then I am more sceptical about the need. The problem is that there is no really pressing â€˜science and technology of moral enhancementâ€™ to engage with. Everything is extremely speculative at present. Given how hard to get a handle on moral living is, that should be no surprise.Just as moral bioenhancement is no great hope to get all excited about, likewise it is not any great threat to be terrified about either, and for the same reasons. Biology just is not â€˜the main thingâ€™ when it comes to moral formation. Biologically meddling with moral formation will remain, at best, a single dimension of larger bio-psycho-social (-spiritual) way of thinking about things. Taking this more modest outlook, where biology is understood to be a single, limited prong in a much larger picture, we see that an urgent public theology is not much needed to prepare us from some impending freight train of great change â€” there is no impending freight train as far as moral enhancement is concerned.Indeed, there are plenty of much more pressing issues in the public space right now that need to be discussed. In that sense, public theology would be much more usefully directed towards issues of the environment, of news bots, of human trafficking, of the rise of tyranny in the world, the loss of privacy, and the incredibly fast-paced datafication consuming all human existence. When one considers how significant these all-too-real contemporary issues are, Iâ€™m afraid to say that the more fantastical moral enhancement discourse pales in comparison. If we are talking about preparatory engagement, the things that stand in need of urgent public theological discussion right now, I would say that moral enhancement does not even make it onto the map.Many thanks, Harris.Harris Wiseman is currently a Research Associate at the University of Birminghamâ€™s Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religion; and Honorary Senior Research Associate at the Institute of Education, UCL.

But itâ€™s nice to get feedback from some of you saying â€œ ME TOO!â€ I usually pick on my husband and my youngest because my husband is fun to pick on and my youngest has introduced levels of #inmyfeelings that Iâ€™ve never experienced. So for the sake of equity, I will share a little more about my oldest. She is 11 and is in 5th grade. In a nutshell she is a pretty typical kid. Except that sheâ€™s not in a lot of ways once you start peeling back a few layers. I didnâ€™t realize how typical I wanted her to be when she first started school. I even had hopes that she may even be exceptional in all the â€œrightâ€ ways. But #blessthischild she struggled. We saw it in school in subtle ways until she got older and the content grew more difficult. She was struggling to pass tests and to keep herself on top of things. Side note, sheâ€™s very social in a â€œlikes to talk and mother hen peopleâ€. She does love people (although sheâ€™s still learning how to be a good friend to all) and ALWAYS ALWAYS not just roots for the underdog but wants to reach out or help them in some way. Digressionâ€¦.We were seeing that her knowledge about things at home wasnâ€™t consistent with her grades in school. We eventually had her privately tested and learned she is dyslexic and has ADD. I was ALWAYS very vocal about ADD being a perceived condition in many situations. (I know, I want to slap me too) I thought I/society could cure EVERYTHING with proper diet, balanced home life, managed screen time, and a strong spiritual foundation. Guess what? It didnâ€™t even touch it. Now I know a few things: I DONâ€™T have all of the answers, we are one of MANY families that deal with this (itâ€™s becoming so common), and she IS exceptional in all the right ways and this will eventually go on to help her in the long runâ€¦.she will just struggle through school. Guess what else? Children are dying of CANCER and other diseases EVERYDAY. Children suffer at the hands of adults in atrocious ways EVERYDAY. Dyslexia with a heavy touch of ADD? Not gonna sweat it. Wellâ€¦in my mind anyway. Because DEAR JESUS LORD OF HOSTS I CANâ€™T HANDLE ANOTHER MORNING OF HER NOT LISTENING. #wailandgnash Wanna know something about a tween with ADD and dyslexia (which basically means she processes things WAY different)? The whole â€œnot listeningâ€ thing is a double stamp on a triple stamp. A DOUBLE STAMP ON A TRIPLE STAMP! (unless you have a multitude of kids, then, wellâ€¦â€¦go with God.)â€œIndia we are leaving in 5 minutes and Iâ€™ve reminded you SEVERAL TIMES about that. Why have you unloaded the kitchen stuff-drawer onto the floor? India: â€œI was just looking for something and then thought Iâ€™d organize the drawer.â€ Composed Mom: India we are WALKING OUT THE DOOR IN FIVE MINUTES WHY WOULD YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD PLAN? India: <blank stare with no answer> (which by the way makes it WAY WORSE!)â€œIndia why do you have containers on the floor with a wet mess around you?â€ India: I was just squeezing these capri suns into a water bottle.â€ Composed mom: â€œPlease clean up the mess and go to the sink.â€10 minutes later wet mess still on the floor, India on the couch squeezing capri suns into the water bottle still while watching tv. Non-composed mom: !!!$%#@%&*&%&*&%$#@@##$!@!#%$% Do you not remember me telling you to clean the mess and go to the sink? <blank stare>It doesnâ€™t dawn on her to acknowledge a mess or not unload the kitchen drawer when we are walking out the door. It doesnâ€™t dawn on her to follow directions because she never really heard you. My insides shake when I tell her to do something so many times and then she just doesnâ€™t do it. NO such punishment exists that gets her to remember OR pay attention. She forgets, doesnâ€™t listen, and has a WILL that does NOT correspond with my bottom line all while staring at me with a blank face because she canâ€™t remember any of our conversation. I should have compassion, but I canâ€™t find it 5 minutes before we are supposed to be WALKING OUT THE DOOR!In that light, here are some apps that can help with kids that have ADD/ADHD (to help them complete tasks) that I am trying out of desperation because boss I am tired: (adult ADD is also real and there are apps that help with that too)note* Download these to their device, prop device up in a central location or wherever they get ready, begin timer or app at home OR in the classroom.Morning Routine: Allows you to set up your own activities with timers. So easy and free. This one is one of my favorites so far.Kids Timer: For kids maybe 3rd grade and younger. Not for the aspiring tween who thinkest herself an adult already.Your phoneâ€™s timer: nuff saidOctopus (or other) Smart Watch for kids: I LOVE this watch other than the occasional syncing issues. India didnâ€™t like the feel of it on her wrist OH YEAH and she lost it SEVERAL times. Would be great for a kid asking for a watch. PSA â€” get a watch screen cover for it.Visual Timer: I LOVE this one because ADD kids are SO VISUAL about things that fall into the â€œmaybe I should remember thisâ€ category. The timer shows a big face clock that minimizes color as the hand counts down.Reminder app on smart phone: Create reminders that repeat daily at the same time. It will automatically buzz their phone when it should happen. (for older kids)Apps Iâ€™m exploring but havenâ€™t used yet:MyADHD: The all-in-one app for guidance and help, activities, organization, and even a diagnostic test for all ages. Looking forward to diving into this one more.Bear in Mind: A timer/organizer app. Looks like you can get what you need from Morning Routine instead of buying this one but it most likely has more features and is only $1.99.Dictation apps like Dragon Dictation. Folks with ADD (especially kids) have fast brains and can often get their thoughts out to complete tasks if they can speak to text.Thatâ€™s a wrap and hereâ€™s to continued success!

Whether itâ€™s easing the burden of governance and compliance obligations using AI decision support tools modelled on the knowledge of experts, or developing a chatbot to answer complex customer questions, Artificial Intelligence can be applied across all industries and companies are increasingly becoming aware of the value that AI can add.However, when speaking to businesses about Artificial Intelligence, a key problem that we encounter is their perception of it; they are either extremely cynical of the technology or they have extremely high expectations of what it can do. This is in part due to the mediaâ€™s overblown coverage of AI; from a TV show about Artificial Intelligence as sentient beings to articles suggesting that we will soon be working for a â€œRobo-bossâ€.A Terminator-esque future is being propounded by the media which is creating an atmosphere of fear surrounding AI and the role that it will play in the future.This negative portrayal by the media is explicit to a branch of Artificial Intelligence known as General AI, which is focused on developing an AI that has equal or greater intellectual capability to humans. In reality we are still a long way from this and people are right to be cynical of it, but itâ€™s important to note that the AI tools that are being effectively used today belong to Narrow AI; that is to say non-sentient technology that is focused on one specific task. This distinction between General and Narrow AI isnâ€™t acknowledged in the media and has tainted peopleâ€™s perception of, and their reaction to, AI.My mission is to change the rhetoric surrounding Artificial Intelligence. At BJSS, we talk about Applied Artificial Intelligence; a collection of Narrow AI systems that are intricately stitched together to create a wide AI solution for businesses, designed with the end users in mind. We use Applied AI to create bespoke solutions that empower clients and deliver demonstrable business results, rather than limiting them to a specific AI tool.The current perception of AI in the media doesnâ€™t take into account the success of these bespoke Applied AI solutions. Itâ€™s time that we make the distinction between the current capabilities of Narrow AI and the future potential of General AI. After all, Applied AI is where the true value of current AI capabilities lie.Originally published at https://www.linkedin.com in February 2017.----Founding Partner at Emergence, delivering profound transformation with emerging tech.Passionate about diversity and inclusivity, especially women in tech.Katie GibbsinDataDrivenInvestor--Katie Gibbs--1Katie Gibbs--Katie Gibbs--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Scott H.

Speaking to CBS Newsâ€™ Scott Pelley in an interview for 60 minutes Kai Fu Lee stated that 40% of all human jobs could be replaced by Automation by 2030. Chauffeurs, truck drivers and a host of working class individuals could see their stability threatened.Currently financial advisement jobs are being replaced by innovations such as Acorns, Betterment, Ally Invest, Swell and Bloom. These platforms offer taxable IRA, Roth IRA, Apex Backed Clearing and create guidance for as little as a flat $10.00 fee.No minimum balance requirements mean that there is no distinction of â€œqualified clientsâ€. Independent financial sector jobs are under threat. It appears that every single sector of our economy is experiencing the wave of automation. Jobs that perform basic functions such as manufacturing, mechanic assembly and agriculture cultivation are increasingly evolving to eliminate human interaction. At some point there is a tipping point between population growth and job shrinkage.When do we arrive at the point where there are not enough jobs to fill a growing population?Even Lockeed Martin and Boeing are experimenting with robotic soldiers. Yes the battlefield appears to be under threat â€” and most people do not seek to risk their lives to earn paychecks. It appears that everything is on the menu for Robots to consume.How do you make money? How do you still capitalize? How do you stay relevant in an emerging market?Creativity, artistic expression and cultural imagination are fields that robots have no adaptability for. Indeed the only field that appears safe is one of artistic inspiration.Humans have no limit on abstract art creation, innovation of previously uncoordinated designs or inspirations resulting from uncanny sources.The future of profits is found with people who imagine, innovate and design new concepts. In approaching deals I continually find ways to design, fit, and custom tailor solutions that have never been offered.The ability to adapt to any situation and create a cohesive presentation is my relevance. There is no such thing as â€œBusiness as Usualâ€.As technology evolves mundane routine tasks are easy targets. The ability to stay relevant relies upon innovation and the ability to say â€œWhy Not?â€ Wisdom is often simple. Complexity is often the excuse of uncertain people or lack of mastery. E=MC/\2 is a three variable equation utilized to summarize complex mathematical theories about the origins of the universe.Long equations are typically hypothesis that predict but lack basis to clearly prove ideas. Ray Kurzweil is a profound American Inventor and futurist. Mr. Kurzweil is a MIT graduate and is greatly known for the prediction of technologies such as the smart phone, internet, speech recognition software and host of other technologies before their advent. Mr. Kurzweilâ€™s predictions were made during a time where society contested the idea that such technologies would replace conventional methodologies.Mr. Kurzweilâ€™s current prediction centers on Universal Basic Income (UBI) and societyâ€™s main desire to find purpose. In other words a man who has about a 70% accuracy predicting technological future events thinks society will be consumed with finding purpose. The pursuit of this desire will result in money allocation towards people who satisfy this desire. Mr. Kurzweil believes that people will actively seek, pay and participate in activities that give them purpose.Time and time again the great human consistency is to appreciate: music, art, and forms of creative expression.As society progresses into an age of automation the one consistency I anticipate will remain is desire to seek individuals who 1) innovate, 2) create, and 3) bring purpose. As you ponder on your entrepreneurial endeavors ask three (3) simple questions:1) Do I innovate new feelings, ideas and inspirations?2) Do I create new concepts, structures and frameworks?3) Do I bring purpose to my clientsâ€™ lives, work and goals?Itâ€™s my firm belief the only relevant individual will be those that solicit positive answers to these questions. This article seems abstract, full of philosophy and opinionated. These are all the characteristics robots are not. These are all the things that artificial intelligence cannot replace. Cultivate what robots cannot if you want to stay relevant. Donâ€™t be replaced by failing to adapt to change. Change might adapt to you and leave you as yesterdayâ€™s model.****About Christopher: Christopher Knight Lopez is a Professional Entrepreneur.

To many, the name Great Scott is up there with the biggest personalities and brands on the Internet. From a very young age, Scott decided he was going to take his destiny into his own hands. Scott has taken an incredible eye for trends and an exceptional knowledge of marketing to become a self-made maven. His resume includes work with companies like Billionaire Boys Club, Heineken, and Reebok just to name a few. One of the first sites of its kind, Scott built and ran Purple Mango, a blog that took on a life of its own. By experimenting with overtly sexual content while still teaching people about business, over the years Scott has built a cult following. Now, in a new chapter of his life and career, Scott is ready to introduce a website that gives content back to contributors. I was able to get the chance to talk to Scott and learn more about the man behind the myth. We talked about everything. From his childhood, to what he really thinks about fame, to how depression pushed him to start his own company called Cewebity. I hope you enjoy. Peace.- TE P.Letâ€™s start from the beginningâ€¦ Where are you from? Who is Scott McKenzie?Great Scott: Iâ€™m from East Orange, NJ. My Mother was born in England. My family is from Jamaica but my Grandmother moved to England where she had her kids. After she had kids she moved to America. Thatâ€™s how my Mother met my Father. They went to Orange High School together. My Father is half white and half black. All I know is he turned Muslim. He didnâ€™t practice and then out of nowhere, after I was born, he told my Mother that he was Muslim and he wanted multiple wives. He legally changed his name and changed identities completely. With all that being said, my Fatherâ€™s side was on heroin and crack cocaine. I was born in 1985, the crack era, which played a huge role in my upbringing. My Motherâ€™s side was selling it. My Fatherâ€™s side was using it. Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t really know my Fatherâ€™s side because most of them died sharing needles. My Father is still alive. I always try to get context into why people do what they do. Iâ€™m assuming all of this played a huge roll in why my Father did what he did.Growing up in East Orange I grew up around all of this shit. My Uncles used to take me on robberies and they would put the jewelry or whatever in my pockets. But, down the street from us, The Fugees. Wyclef, Lauryn Hill, and all of them were recording the first album, â€œBlunted On Realityâ€ and the second album, â€œThe Scoreâ€. I got to meet them just growing up down the street. Knowing them changed my life. Through knowing them I met the CEO of Sony. He came to the house in a limousine. I was so surprised and anxious. Iâ€™m like 9 years old and wanted to know what he did for a living because he owns a limousine. I wanted to be a rapper until I met him. I asked him, â€œWhat do you do for a living, sir?â€ And he said, â€œIâ€™m the CEO of Sony Records kid.â€ After that, I didnâ€™t know what a CEO was, but I wanted to be one.With you beginning to realize what you wanted to do in life, was all of the crazy shit still going down with your family? I assume everything didnâ€™t just stop.Great Scott: Hell YEAH! There was a lot of crazy shit going on. I remember. I almost got kidnapped for something one of my Uncles had done. This is how I found out what my family was really into. They wanted to murder me to get back at my Uncle because he murdered two people. There was some gang shit going down. I was just trying to understand what they kept pressing me about. So I went home and asked him. I asked him, â€œUncle Mark, you killed somebody?â€ and he looked at me and just said, â€œYeah.â€ I ran upstairs and told my Mother (laughs). She went downstairs and an argument started but that was my family.â€œâ€¦I didnâ€™t know what a CEO was, but I wanted to be one.â€ â€” Great Scott McKenzieWhat did you do after you decided to become a CEO?Great Scott: I had someone tell me, â€œYou need to take time to learn before you become a boss.â€ So I decided to take time to learn the business. They also told me, â€œFind a role model.â€ So the first role model I chose was Puffy. It was around â€™97. Right when Biggie died. When I saw the mermaid in the living room in the â€œHypnotizeâ€ video it really fucked me up. I was like, â€œHeâ€™s a genius. Who does that?â€ He blew up a Rolls Royce in Canâ€™t Hold Me Down. The budgets Puffy was spending at that time, nobody was spending that kind of money on videos. He was turning music videos into movies. I was highly impressed and I said, â€œI want to be like this guy.â€ Thatâ€™s where it all started. So I went to Barnes & Noble's and read up on him [Puffy]. I read he was an intern for Andre Harrell so I was like, â€œI gotta be an intern.â€ I interned for OutKastâ€™s clothing line. I interned for Ruff Rydersâ€™ clothing line. I interned for Fetish â€” Eveâ€™s clothing line. I swept up at music video sets. I did everything I could just to get my feet wet.I feel like a lot of these things are lost now. A lot of these names are lost. What was it like being there at that time when Hip-Hop was reaching heights it had never reached before?Great Scott: True. True. True. I donâ€™t know how to explain it. Iâ€™m 31. Youâ€™re gonna keep hearing that those times were better than these. Maybe itâ€™s because niggas had so much to prove then. Remember, at the beginning of Hip-Hop even if you â€œmade itâ€, they wouldnâ€™t play you on the radio. MTV wasnâ€™t even playing Michael Jackson at one time. Thatâ€™s what made it more fun. But people donâ€™t know what thatâ€™s like. Everybody had so much to prove to outdo each other. Everybody had their own swag and energy. I remember when â€˜Clef [Wyclef Jean] picked up the guitar and people said that it wasnâ€™t Hip-Hop. Heâ€™s the first Hip-Hop artist to play Carnegie Hall. Not Jay-Z. I also think itâ€™s harder to appreciate it as much now because the money was also new then. Nowadays a Lil Yachty or Desiigner can get 100k for a walkthrough. Nobody was seeing anything close to that back then. Itâ€™s hard for them to appreciate a Tupac or Biggie. They donâ€™t have to respect the past really.Do you think there was a larger emphasis on building relationships then?Yep. You had to pay your dues then. Back then you had to know your history. You had to respect legendary DJâ€™s. Now you donâ€™t really have to. You had to understand. Thatâ€™s why relationships were important because if you met somebody you had to have a real conversation about culture. Now, itâ€™s more about popularity and numbers on Instagram. Thereâ€™s an illusion of people knowing you. Fame is so much different now. People are famous off of things that are so simple. Look at the red sweater guy from the debate. I looked at it and he didnâ€™t do anything to get famous. Itâ€™s not his fault but people are getting famous for dumb shit. You donâ€™t need relationships anymore if you can have someone like Kim Kardashian whose business plan is sucking dick to get famous.â€œYou donâ€™t need relationships anymore if you can have someone like Kim Kardashian whose business plan was sucking dick to get famous. â€œ â€” Great Scott McKenzieI can tell you are the kind of person who completely believes in everything you do. With the incredible internships youâ€™ve had, were you thinking, â€œIâ€™m just going to outwork everybody?â€At that time I just wanted to be in the business so badly. Now itâ€™s easier. Then it was much more difficult to be down. There was such a tight-knit energy. I just wanted to show and prove. I wanted people to know Iâ€™m serious about this. You really had to bust your balls for those niggas to respect you. So I used to sweep up. I would wash niggas cars. I did all types of shit. You had to pay dues for niggas to invite you places. I just wanted to be down.I know you interned at XXL. What was that like being there in the early 2000â€™s?I got there around 2003 because it was right when the whole 50 Cent thing blew up. It was right when he did the Money, Power, Respect cover with Em and Dre. That was a classic cover because it sold a lot. At that time it sold 5 million. At that time for a magazine that was a huge number. The average magazine at that time would do 200,000 in sales. But 5 million copies of a magazine was humongous. I got with them right at that time. I was only interning with the fashion department but that is how I was able to get to the Pharrell camp. I lied to the security guard at BAPE and told him I could get his clothing line in XXL if he was able to get me to anybody that knew Pharrell. I sold him a dream that I didnâ€™t know I could pull off. But, it worked and he took me to the front door of BBCâ€™s office at the time. Crazy enough, I was able to get his clothes in XXL and VIBE twice.How did you end up getting a job at Billionaire Boys Club?I would walk there every day. I would have my resume and I would say, â€œCan I work here? Can I intern here?â€ Someone would always answer the door and they would tell me they werenâ€™t looking for anyone right now. I did this for eight months straight until they got tired of me. It also took a little luck. I was at Wyclefâ€™s studio one day and his manager was going to a store called Sneaker Pimpâ€™s. I knew BBC/ICE CREAMâ€™s skate team would be there so I asked him if I could go. He said, â€œAit. Letâ€™s go.â€ As soon as we got there Loic and Phillip were there and Charmin introduced us. Heâ€™s very credible in the music business and they knew him. I donâ€™t think they would have taken a chance on me if I didnâ€™t get that introduction. I actually walked up to Phillip in the party and I told him I would do anything it took to be down with them. He looked at me and told me, â€œShut The Fuck Up. Come tomorrow at 7 oâ€™ clock. Donâ€™t be late.â€ Nigga, I was there at 5 oâ€™ clock in the morning.â€œHe looked at me and told me, â€œShut The Fuck Up. Come tomorrow at 7 o'clock. Donâ€™t be late.â€ Nigga, I was there at 5 o'clock in the morning.â€ â€” Great Scott McKenzieA lot has been said about the fashion industry and its internship practices. Being that you went through the grind, what do you think about internships and how they are used as an essential part of the business?I think internships are needed but the companies abuse them. I think a lot of companies donâ€™t want to take care of the basic needs of interns. They could at least take care of food and transportation. I think thatâ€™s fair for every intern. But then again people are spoiled now and expect a fucking occupation out of nowhere. You have to build your trust and you have to earn it. Thatâ€™s the problem with the game now. People donâ€™t want to earn it. They donâ€™t have to respect you anymore. Itâ€™s fucked up on both ends. Donâ€™t let them abuse you. If you are an intern and you give a grand idea and they fuck with it, fight for your rights to get your money. Especially, if you proved you made that company money. Thatâ€™s what you should do. A lot of times you will give a company an idea and they won't pay you. Iâ€™ve done it with Sprite, Heineken, and many other brands. I didnâ€™t get any money from it but you donâ€™t realize it until afterward.What did you learn from seeing people's interactions with you change once they found out you were connected to somebody like Pharrell?I do want to say itâ€™s corny at the end of the day. Itâ€™s crazy and sad how people treat based on where you work versus who you are as a person. A lot of these people in the business arenâ€™t good people. They are pieces of shit to be honest. People know the only value they have is their job title. Of course, once I left BBC I got the real reality check. I realized, â€œYou are nobody, Nigga.â€ I was only somebody based on the people I was associated with. Itâ€™s cool. Iâ€™m honest with myself about that.After all the time you spent with famous people or people we would call â€œcelebritiesâ€, what is a takeaway, what is something you would tell these kids?In my opinion, itâ€™s all business. Ainâ€™t nobody your friend. Thatâ€™s one. Iâ€™m not saying any of these people are my friends. Itâ€™s business. There is so much fakeness. Itâ€™s so fake. Itâ€™s so corny. But you shut the fuck up because you just have to play your position. If youâ€™re too honest you lose your position. Youâ€™re not going to make it in the game being honest. Period. I donâ€™t give a FUCK what anybody says. The truth is they all want to be famous, they are all emotional sensitive and they use fame to replace true love that they want from somebody in their personal life. Fan love and popularity replaces love at home. If you had true love at home and real human emotions you donâ€™t need to be famous. Youâ€™d do everything to avoid it.â€œA lot of these people in the business arenâ€™t good people. They are pieces of shit, to be honest.â€ â€” Great Scott McKenzieOk. So you know we have to talk about Purple Mango. I feel like whenever I hear people talk about itâ€¦ Itâ€™s almost in a whisper. Itâ€™s like folklore. People want to know where the FUCK you went.I fell off the radar. That was intentional.Ok. So what made you start Purple Mango? Give me the back-story, because people are still tweeting things you did years ago.I was actually put onto Tumblr by a friend named Remy. He had a blog called The Dean. Him and Giovanni Perez used to be on Tumblr heavy. I just made an account. I liked all the sexual visuals I was bumping into. I think at the time Twitter and Facebook had restrictions. I could see Tumblr was different. I was addicted. I would just post little stuff to see if people responded. At the time I didnâ€™t have a lot of followers on Twitter or Facebook. But people responded strongly to my post. Purple Mango was a random name I made up. It has no meaning. Itâ€™s funny, when you play with things what they can become. I was teaching people about business and all that shit. I incorporated mad random shit. It got a lot of numbers. I would post about terrorists. I would post a speech from Malcolm-X. Then, right underneath, there would be a woman giving a blowjob. Thatâ€™s how my mind works. Purple Mango was random fuckery. Righteousness and Ratchetness.Why did you leave?My Mom was telling me it wouldnâ€™t be good for my image. I had just dropped a book and at that time you couldnâ€™t be as free. I listened to my Mom and it was the dumbest thing I did. People would hit me and tell me they missed Purple Mango. Iâ€™m on it now to get inspiration. Iâ€™m in it for the experience.When did you decide to take things back and give people the option to make money off of their content with Cewebity?It started with Reebok. I used to be a brand ambassador for them. I didnâ€™t like that we had made them $80,000 with the Grilled Cheese parties and when I asked the CEO for a raise he told me no. I got tired of seeing old white men tell me what to do with my shit and my culture. So I got real depressed and left. I said, â€œI need to formulate a planâ€. I wanted to study how I could create a formula like an Adidas, like a Ford, like a Proctor & Gamble. Thatâ€™s how Cewebity was thought about. Around 2013 I started brainstorming the site. I wanted to make sense of it all. My biggest beef is that these people are supposed to take us higher and help us elevate ourselves. But they arenâ€™t. They arenâ€™t making more leaders. These companies want you to stay where you are. Itâ€™s almost they donâ€™t even want to have you work hard. You just have to work enough to get by.â€œThey arenâ€™t making more leaders. These companies want you to stay where you are.â€ â€” Great Scott McKenzieWould you say weâ€™ve given our culture away?Heavy. Heavy. Heavy! I think the real truth is these people donâ€™t have a talent. I donâ€™t want to attack them. But they donâ€™t give a fuck about us on that scale. And of course, some niggas are gonna be niggas. But I couldnâ€™t take advantage of somebody like that. Iâ€™m starting Cewebity as a vengeance to get back at everybody. I donâ€™t give a FUCK.What is it like being in that space? Being two young black dudes in a tech world that weâ€™re really not represented in? You two are almost counterculture.Itâ€™s hard. Itâ€™s very hard to get help. There are very little black people who will be able to help. Because of the lack of black people in this space there is also a lack of case studies that show black people are good at coming up with great tech companies. Itâ€™s a hard fight. Weâ€™ve gotten burned out of our money a lot. Weâ€™ve been working on this since 2013. Legally we were ready by 2014. Itâ€™s 2016 and the site has only been up for a month because it took that long to get the money together to pull this shit off. But we did and we arenâ€™t using excuses. Itâ€™s a process. Itâ€™s a fucking process. Itâ€™s a struggle.If I was to run into somebody tomorrow and they were to ask me how you were, what would you want me to say?Iâ€™m freaky. Iâ€™m saucy. Iâ€™m good. I got no issues. Iâ€™m used to confrontation. Itâ€™s a comfort zone for me to go through issues and problems. I just had to get off social media to get my mind right and figure out the world for what it is. I got two years to learn life. I learned chemistry and philosophy. I can break down a tree for you. I can break down the molecules of your skin. I took a long time to study this shit. So now when I get back in the game nobody can manipulate me. I got a lot of knowledge of myself. I already know weâ€™re about to be good. I look at my life and I always wanted to work for Pharrell, made it happen. I always wanted to work the MTV Awards, I made that happen with Wale. Iâ€™ve had my own house. Iâ€™m only 31. I lost a lot at 27. But, that was important. The great thing about going through that is, I know what it takes to get it and itâ€™s nothing to reset yourself. People go through things. I was emotionally more fucked up than physically or monetarily because I saw the industry for what it was. But, Iâ€™m not turning into them. Iâ€™m not going to sell you no dream and all this other shit. Iâ€™m going to be honest. Iâ€™m gonna make sure, on my life, I will make sure these people suffer for what theyâ€™ve done because they donâ€™t respect the shoulders we stand on. We gotta change this FUCKING system.â€We gotta change this FUCKING system!â€ â€” Great Scott McKenzie----TE P.--TE P.--TE P.--TE P.--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Business services company Aon, alongside international charity confederation Oxfam, seek to utilize blockchain technology to provide farmers in Sri Lanka cover in the event of extreme weather conditions. The collaborations have seen the two entities team up with blockchain insurance started Ethersic to launch a decentralized insurance platform for the farmers of Sri Lanka.An announcement released by Aon, outlined that the project will help automate the insurance process by retrieving data from automated weather stations placed around the country. In the event there is extremely high or low rainfall, the farmerâ€™s crops are affected and leave the farmers with little to no crops to earn a living. Traditionally any insurance claims would require the insurance company to travel to the area to confirm that the crops have been affected by drought or flood. By integrating automated weather stations, should there be extremely high or low rainfall, the data recovered by the weather stations will automatically trigger the claims process for the farmers.The automated service, which is built on blockchain platform provided by Ethersic, will not only reduces overall cost but greatly reduce the time taken to process claims as well as address several other key issues regarding the farmers insurance. Through utilizing blockchain technology, insurance is now more affordable due to its automated service. As the automated platform provides a much more streamlined service for users, it now allows for a much more accessible platform for users. Using a mobile or computer, users and insurers can both have access to a â€œsingle source of truthâ€ to ensure all parties are complying with the terms of the insurance.Bojan Kolundzija, Oxfamâ€™s director in Sri Lanka, stated:â€œAllowing farmers to access the blockchain platform is an important milestone that is bringing an effective and affordable risk transfer mechanism to a large portion of the Sri Lanka economy.â€Etherisc CIO, Michiel Berende, commented that the Sri Lankan agricultural industry employs about one-third of the workforce in Sri Lanka as well as represents one-fifth of the nationâ€™s economy. Furthermore, very few of this extremely large workforce have any form of insurance making it an ideal place to start this platform.Sources: prnewswire.com, newsbtc.com, aon.mediaroom.com----The comprehensive payment solution making crypto accessible to everyone.

That seemed pretty straight-forward; I would just need to record and replay the exact same near-field communication (NFC) signal emitting from my (contactless-enabled) credit card. So, as with any new idea I tapped in to the near limitless wealth of knowledge powered by the culmination of mankindâ€™s technology advances in the palm of my hands â€” I Googled for answers.As it turns out â€” not surprisingly, it isnâ€™t as simple as copy-pasting my card number or mimicking a radio signal. I quickly realise it is not possible because of various limitations in part due to the EMV protocol implementation. Some of the more interesting facts/limitation I found include:Coupled with various other strategy and algorithms employed by the EMV standard and banks, which are ever-evolving to combat fraud, it seems like an eternal uphill battle.It led me to ponder about those fancy mobile payment we hear about; Apple Pay, Samsung Pay or the other similar payment methods out there.First, letâ€™s dive under the hood to understand the implementation of the various mobile payment methodsI shall start my path on Google to search for answers again.Payment methods such as Apple pay & Google pay have working partnerships with major banks and card network that allow them to essentially re-create a symbolic link of the card itself.What this means is that the card stored in the phone is a virtual â€œcopyâ€ of the original but by all intents and purposes is a totally unrelated card. When the merchant tries to process the transaction on the virtual card, the network (Visa, Mastercard, etc) identifies the virtual card, find out the actual card number represented by that card and forwards it to the issuing entity; usually the customerâ€™s card issuing bank. If everything checks out, the flow reverses with the issuing entity responding with transaction approval until the merchant receives the payment complete message.Whoa, that is more complicated than I initially imagined; but Iâ€™m not giving up.I shall dig deeper.Apple handles this by storing a tokenised copy of the data representing the stored credit card in the secure element chip which can only be decrypted by the cardâ€™s payment network. Appleâ€™s servers does not store any card number nor have access to any card data.For more details, Apple has a pretty detailed article on the security and privacy of Apple pay hereFor Android pay, Google had to come up with an alternate solution since the hardware is not as tightly coupled as iPhone & iOS and not all devices will contain a secure element chip. Google introduced the solution in Android 4.4 called Host Card Emulation (HCE). A simple way to think of it is that the secure chip is now on the cloud in Googleâ€™s servers. The Android device will store a limited set of tokens generated by the Googleâ€™s servers and will then transmit it using NFC to POS terminals when needed; essentially emulating the card without storing any card-related information.One key difference in this approach is that the card information is therefore no longer stored on the device as opposed to Appleâ€™s device hardware only implementation.*It is unclear at this stage if Google stores only tokenised card data or actual card data in their servers but in this article we assume only tokenised card data are stored on Googleâ€™s serversMore details on Googleâ€™s implementation can be found hereThis makes Googleâ€™s implementation slightly less secure and private but it does provide numerous benefits â€” mainly scalability and lower cost which in turn to drive up adoption which make perfect sense considering Androidâ€™s business structure.From the complex payment flow involving different mobile operating systems, manufacturers, banks & payment networks it seem near impossible to simply replicate what the big tech companies have done.But..it canâ€™t really be the case right?Time to dig deeper.To start off, adding any credit or debit card to the mobile wallet service will encrypt the card information, and only the wallet service provider can decrypt, before sending it securely to the mobile wallet service providerâ€™s server(Apple, Google, Samsung etc). It then triggers a request to the payment network for a tokenised data that represents the card. This is the only time the actual card number in its encrypted form ever gets sent from the device.The payment network, issuing banks and any bank authorised service provider, all plays a part in tokenising the card. Specifically, the payment network which acts as the Token Service Provider (TSP) provides a token & a token key to the issuing bank. In some cases, an authorised third party can act as the TSP instead. The issuing bank will then tags a credit verification value (cvv) key to the data and forwards it to the mobile wallet service provider. The mobile wallet service provider will then store the information in the secure element chip(in Appleâ€™s case), or on a secure server (in Googleâ€™s case).So, at this point we have already established that no actual card numbers are stored on the device and our hopes and dreams of are utterly destroyed.Darn it! Butâ€¦ Could we somehow store the tokenise card and use it ourselves then?Maybe, if I could somehow go furtherâ€¦Remember the 3 things we got from the payment network and stored in secure element? The token, which is basically your tokenised card aka virtual card, the token key, which generates a cryptogram based on data such as the token, token key, transaction value etc (just think of it as a unique one-time password you get in SMS messages), and the cvv key, which generates a dynamic cvv number(the 3 digit number you find behind most credit cards)Those information get sent via NFC using a contactless payment protocol to the merchantâ€™s payment terminal which forwards it to the payment network. Each entity that issued the tokens verifies the data accordingly and determines if the transaction is valid. The TSP then verifies that the cryptogram is valid and de-tokenise the virtual card â€” matching the virtual card with the actual card number, and forwards the actual card number with the dynamic cvv to the issuing bank. The issuing bank in turn verifies the dynamic cvv and authorises the transaction. The authorisation flows in reverse back to the merchantâ€™s payment device and the transaction is completed.There are a few key security features to note. Just like the regular EMV-Contactless chip, the signal sent by the NFC from the mobile device is only valid for a one-time usage. The cryptogram ensures that the same data canâ€™t be charged twice and the transaction value or any other related value are intact. And at this point the dynamic cvv is just defense in depthâ€™s icing on the cake.Well then. Now that Iâ€™ve gotten to bottom of it, maybe itâ€™s time to accept that it canâ€™t be done â€” at least for now.While there is no such thing as perfect security but it will take a whole lot more work to crack at this.----2Android Software Engineer.

This time, on October 16, the carrier is launching a beta version of the new Uber Pet option in several US cities.The function is intended for those who need to get from one point of the city to another with their pet. Choosing this option will cost an additional 3â€“5 dollars, but the client will be completely sure that the driver will not refuse the trip because of a tailed passenger.At the moment, customers have to notify the driver on their own that they will have an animal with them. Many people forget to mention this when placing an order, and then run into trouble: not all drivers are ready to let four-legged representatives into their car. Someone is afraid for the cleanliness and safety of the car interior, someone is afraid of aggression from animals, and someone is completely allergic to wool and is not going to sacrifice health at work.Thanks to the innovation, passengers will be able to select the Uber Pet function when placing an order â€” and only those drivers for whom transporting a client with a furry friend will not be a problem will respond to such requests.The only exception to the rule are service dogs: according to the companyâ€™s rules, such animals are allowed to accompany their owners in taxis at no extra charge under any circumstances.Representatives of Uber hope that the introduction of such a feature will avoid conflicts between drivers and passengers, as well as reduce the number of orders canceled for this reason.----Startup ReviewsKatty BrunetteinStartup Reviews--Anna VasilevainStartup Reviews--Katty BrunetteinStartup Reviews--Katty BrunetteinStartup Reviews--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

May we know them, may we meet them and may we raise them.â€The tech industry in Nigeria has taken off, but how many female techies are on board?It is no longer news that the global tech industry has over the years emerged from the shadows to gain preeminence over other major economy drivers. While this has come with a wave of new entrants in the promising sector that has produced the likes of Billionaires Bill gates and Mark Zuckerberg, If you take a closer look, away from the glorious chants of fundraising successes, away from the many new ideas that crystallizes into concrete technology solutions each day, you would see a fault in the rocks.An overwhelming majority of the people who control what happens under the hood tend to fall within the male gender. Everyday, the tech talent gender gap continues to widen, and this lack of diversity in tech companies becomes more evident. But this hasnâ€™t always been the case. History has shown that at the time when programming was an emerging field, women were in the forefront of this new technology.Women have been instrumental to the growth of several industries, and the tech industry is no exception. Ada Lovelace, a woman, is known to have been the first computer programmer. As far back as the 1940s, it was recorded that the first programmers to have worked on the US Armyâ€™s ginormous ENIAC computer were all women. These breakthroughs are what have brought us to this point, but the tables have turned, and today, women make up less than a fifth of technical roles in the tech industry.Today, women make up less than a fifth of technical roles in the tech industry.The Nigerian tech industry has seen rapid growth in the number of entrants in recent times and has gotten the attention of the international tech community, but gender imbalance has seeped through the pores and more often than not, companies struggle to hire female talent. One might want to dispute this fact, but the evidence is everywhere and you wouldnâ€™t need to look too far to get the receipts.This gender disparity in the Nigerian tech space is driven by social, psychological and institutional factors that have been passed down over generations. Several instances have arisen where women have been discouraged from taking up jobs in tech as it has been described to be a â€œmanâ€™s jobâ€ and not a career for a woman looking to build a family of her own.â€œLeave â€˜brogrammingâ€™ for the brosâ€ they say.Another major setback to the growth in the number of female techies is set structures or lack of them, that puts women in situations where they do not feel valued; because while attracting women to tech solves one part of the problem, retaining them is the vital and most crucial task for employers and industry leaders. What is the career trajectory for women in your organization? Have you created an environment where women are inclusive and supported? How do you check for gender bias within your team? Are there parental leave policies to enable women to find fulfillment at work and home? What leadership roles do women hold in your company?â€¦ These are some of the issues that should be tackled if weâ€™re looking to change the narrative, bearing in mind the rewards that increased gender diversity offers.Working towards achieving diversity is not only the right thing to do â€” itâ€™s also crucial to business success. Research shows that returns on investment are 53% higher for companies with diverse executive boards. Sheryl Sandberg â€” COO, Facebook, and Susan Wojcicki â€” CEO, Youtube are two powerful women in the industry who make valid this study.The tech industry is growing at an alarming speed, and this is reflected in the level of demand for tech talent. There are more vacant positions in tech than people to fill them. A rise in the number of female techies solves the talent demand problem. As at today, we have a number of Nigerian women in tech, who are paving the way for future innovations and are serving as role models to young women looking to explore opportunities in tech. With communities like SheCodesAfrica, and WomenTechmakers getting more women interested in tech, we see a future where a woman in tech will no longer be an exception, but a norm.Change isnâ€™t an overnight solution. Itâ€™s an effort that takes time, patience and dedication.At Semicolon, we believe in equal opportunities for all, and through our Techpreneur program, weâ€™re working towards building the next generation of women tech leaders. We believe in #BalanceForBetter, after all results have no gender.Happy International Womenâ€™s day!!----Inside SemicolonManaging the content crew at Semicolon; a social impact training institute and innovation hub focused on solving societal problems with disruptive technology.Semicolon Africa--1Semicolon AfricainInside Semicolon--2Semicolon AfricainInside Semicolon--Semicolon AfricainInside Semicolon--1Unbecoming--764The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

408,40009,https://medium.com/@HubSpot/announcing-hubspots-investment-in-crossbeam-46d97e08d95?source=tag_archive---------39-----------------------,Announcing HubSpotâ€™s Investment in Crossbeam,None,HubSpot,https://medium.com/@HubSpot,3,412,2,"HubSpotFollow--ListenShareBy Andrew Lindsay, VP of Corporate and Business Development at HubSpotCrossbeam founders Bob Moore and Buck Ryan are serial entrepreneurs and they know about the importance of partnerships to growing a venture. But they have also observed the simplistic guesswork that companies typically rely on when choosing and managing partnerships. Rough estimates of joint customers and approximations of shared segments have become the status quo.SaaS companies frequently partner to integrate product experiences but rarely integrate their sales and marketing processes.These Philadelphia-based founders decided to tackle this problem head-on with Crossbeam, so that when companies work together, their data can too. We couldnâ€™t be more supportive of this mission and are thrilled to participate in Crossbeamâ€™s Series A led by FirstMark.Crossbeam works across existing systems and securely supports dozens of data sources, from CRMs and warehouses to payment providers and CSVs. From there, the product creates â€œpopulationsâ€ â€” groups of people or companies in data sets â€” to generate qualified leads, customer views, and other marketing opportunities that ultimately help their customers identify overlap with their partnersâ€™ populations. If a userâ€™s partner is not on the platform, Crossbeam will onboard them for free in a few easy steps.The magic happens once this overlap gets surfaced: companies can facilitate partner introductions, and Crossbeam can generate large numbers of partner-qualified leads and also track the revenue impact from each partner channel.This layer of visibility empowers sales and marketing teams to win more deals, avoid channel conflict with direct teams going against channel partners, and ultimately, optimize their revenue growth strategy.The implications of this process are profound. The rate of new business SaaS launches is mind-boggling and customers must consider SaaS solutions for their independent attributes as well as how they fit into a whole stack. The best marketing and sales teams help customers with that process. Those marketing and sales teams donâ€™t just tout their own productâ€™s features, they help customers assemble a stack with complementary partner applications. They help customers identify app combinations that integrate to make 1+1=3. Crossbeam is here to help those better marketing and sales teams.Crossbeamâ€™s mission aligns well with HubSpotâ€™s. As our founder and CTO, Dharmesh Shah, puts it: â€œThereâ€™s a way to grow that doesnâ€™t compromise the customer experience. Thatâ€™s the kind of growth Iâ€™m excited about. Thatâ€™s growing better.â€We are big fans of entrepreneurs solving for ways businesses can grow better, and weâ€™re thrilled to be a part of Crossbeamâ€™s story. Congratulations Bob, Buck, and the entire Crossbeam team. We are excited to grow with you and are honored to be your partner.----Learn how the leading CRM platform is helping millions of organizations around the world Grow Better.HubSpot--2HubSpotinThinkGrowth.org--3HubSpot--HubSpot--3The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404Unbecoming--764Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--121Josep FerrerinGeek Culture--72HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

There is no doubt that this not only defines the direction for the blockchain industry, but also brings more confidence and motivation to the market.TNB development direction: access to integrating with real economyReviewing the development route of TNB in recent years, in the process of deeply exploring the technology integration entity industry, TNB is not only the improve the performance technology itself, but also insists on unifying the interconnection between people and scenes. Through the microscopic model with time as the value carrier, it is striving to realize the co-creation, co-construction, win-win and sharing between multi formats and individuals, the key lies in â€œintegrationâ€. In addition, the starting point for TNB to build a digital time value transmission network is not a simple â€œblockchain +â€ or â€œtechnology +â€, but a real value-oriented potential development for the diversified development in real industries and individuals. It completely eliminates the isolated island effect to improve effective information and value data, and virtually solves the efficiency problems, cost and trust in the process of digital circulation.The blockchain technology featured by decentralization, non-tampering, openness and transparency, contract hard execution and so on, all those features can enhance the ability of intelligent governance for real economy and individuals under a complex business environment. Therefore, in the existing scenario applications, TNB will continue to serve the physical industry with the mature experience the â€œblockchain timeâ€ intelligent governance system and the natural advantages to cross-linking between individuals and scenarios. In addition, in the dual-driven strategic development of â€œPersonal Time Nasdaqâ€ and â€œAutonomously Talent Time Salesâ€, MiaoA has initially achieved a substantial breakthrough in the diversified industrial pattern of â€œblockchain time consumptionâ€. The commercial application based on blockchain time has also formed a differentiated competitive advantage. Its inherent high-throughput, high-concurrent trading module and settlement mode have been regarded as a classic case of deepening microfinance system by public chain technology. Up to now, TNB based on blockchain technology in real economy scenarios has covered many fields, such as high-end knowledge payment, big health, financial consumption, extreme sports diving, professional consulting and so on. TNB already has formed a multi trends in the initial stage of â€œblock chain +â€ ecology.It can be predicted that in the process of continuously opening up the ecological elements such as scene, application, value, data and so on, a series of innovations to promote the transformation and upgrading will become a new round of development trends. At the same time, it will also promote the social consensus based on â€œblockchain + real economyâ€ and accelerate the digital development in traditional enterprises.TNB teamNov. 14----TNB is token that represents MiaoA International Timechain (M.I.T).

While there are definite trends throughout the professions, the actual truth is that software engineers can work in just about any place. From design companies, to finance, to manufacturing, software engineers are being recruited across the board, and thatâ€™s exactly why this career path has been so popular.Regardless of where youâ€™re working, there are a couple of software engineering goals that are given.One of them is designing code to some extent. The other is testing projects and analyzing code for your product. Most importantly, software engineers working for a startup will enjoy being a part of the team.Thereâ€™s always something to be gained by being mentored by a more seasoned veteran or putting your head together with the entire team to get ideas flowing.If youâ€™re starting your career in software engineering, you may be curious as to what a typical day as an engineer may look like.Of course, a lot of factors affect the typical day for a software engineer. If can be quite difficult to describe an average day as a software engineer because when your daily work involves developing products that can solve problems for millions of people all over the world, you cannot have a â€œtypicalâ€™ â€˜day. Each day will come with its own set of challenges.As stated before, there is no â€œtypical dayâ€ for a software engineer, but we put together what may entail on the job in a single day.For the most part, software engineers have very flexible schedules. One of the best parts about working with computers is having the option to work remotely and also to work at any hour of the day. Based on whether youâ€™re a morning person or a night person, youâ€™ll arrive at the office and transition into work.Before leaving the house to go to the office, a software engineer may read his emails but makes a point to never answer before having their first cup of coffee.That would not be a solid idea. Showering, shaving, eating breakfast, drinking a cup of coffee while catching up on any news, and finally commuting to work somewhere between 6â€“9 AM.Once you walk into the office, you get to fill up a cup of coffee, sit at your desk, open your laptop, turn some music on, and read through and check what needs to be done for the day.This time is typically spent coding or meeting with co-workers and clients. Crucial to software engineering is remaining up-to-date on industry trends. Itâ€™s also a good idea to read coding blogs and chat with coworkers so you donâ€™t fall behind.At this time a software engineer may spend time checking over their code every time theyâ€™ve made some progress towards their goal. This can happen every few minutes or hours.Another bonus for flexible hours means to decide how you have lunch. Whether you decide to stay at your desk or go out into the outside world, a mid-day break can be another opportunity to talk with coworkers and get the coding juices flowing. itâ€™s also great to get away from your computer when you are struggling with a programming issue.Once youâ€™ve finished your break, you can jump back into your work. Coding can become incredibly immersive that the hours seem to fly by.Lunch can become optional, depending on your workload. Not because a software engineer is being encouraged to skip lunch, but because they may forget to eat and find a lunch hour to be another decent crunch time.During the early afternoon, you may do some more brainstorming with coworkers, email writing, and bug fixing.At this point, you may go back to a state of intense concentration, and thatâ€™s when problems start getting difficult. As the caffeine may no longer be working to fuel the mind, some of the technical challenges appear to become more difficult than in the morning.Not because they have become harder, it simply due to the brain getting tired. Thatâ€™s when itâ€™s time to start packing up and leaving any final notes on where you left off for the next morning.Nighttime is usually when the long hours start. Depending on the nature of your work and startup, you may need to stay at the office later than other professionals.Even so, your evening end time is usually dependent on your morning start time. As long as youâ€™re putting in the appropriate hours and remain focused during the day, you can finish work at a reasonable hour. Or, if you prefer night-time working, you can get straight to business.The career path for a software engineer is not often dazzling, but it does remain mentally intense.Software engineers will be immersed in a deep state of focus for hours at the time, alternating by family life, hobbies, and social activities.Follow our publication for more Bay area insights and stories!----1The Bay Area InsiderSerial entrepreneur with a passion for storytelling and writing.Richy RichinThe Bay Area Insider--Richy RichinThe Bay Area Insider--2Richy RichinThe Bay Area Insider--Richy RichinThe Bay Area Insider--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alex Mathers--220Unbecoming--764Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"
414,17866,https://medium.com/@samlash35/brain-games-cc6e0289729?source=tag_archive---------75-----------------------,Brain Games,None,Sam Lash,https://medium.com/@samlash35,4,1,0,"Sam LashFollow--ListenShareAre we being controlled by people hunched over on a desk turning little dials in a control room determining our thoughts, feelings, and actions of one billion humans? Sounds crazy, right? Well, this actually happens today in real life. Technology companies controlling our phones and apps are programming these things to sway what 1 billion people are thinking that day. For example, getting a notification on your phone. This is creating thoughts that you may have never wanted to have. Right there when you swipe you are scheduling a time block out of your life that sucks you into the task. We look at technology with this limitless tool that we can use for whatever. However, technology is going in one specific direction. This direction is a war to simply rule your attention. News websites, social media, politicians, sports, video games are all competing for your attention. The best way to get peopleâ€™s attention is to know how someoneâ€™s mind works. There is a bunch of persuasive techniques used in technology to get peopleâ€™s attention. We are being sucked into this trap and the reason we are feeling like we are being sucked in is because of this race for attention. Technology is not a neutral thing. This becomes a race to our brain and its challenging companies on who can go lower. For example snapchat and the snap streak which gives two people something that they donâ€™t want to lose and donâ€™t want to go away. This creates a block of time in their brain to make sure they keep the streak. They arenâ€™t even having real conversations. This isnâ€™t the 1970s where you just talked back and forth on the phone this is where there are 100s of engineers on the other side of the phone that know the exact way your brain works. If so far this is making you feel outraged then notice how natural that feeling came. This is also a good way to get your attention. We donâ€™t choose to be outraged, it just happens to us. Outrage doesnâ€™t just schedule a reaction it moves us to share that outrage which is what social media is trying to make you do by posting on it. The news feed control room is not held accountable. It is based on maximizing attention and the business model of advertising. The advertisers come in with boatloads of money saying I want to put this thought here on these news feeds to persuade this audience. You can precisely target to groups of people that are most persuadable. This is a big problem. This isnâ€™t just changing where our attention is being drawn to. It is changing how we have a conversation, it is changing our democracy and its disabling us to have the relationships we want. And remember one billion people have a smartphone in their pocket.We need to realize that we are persuadable. We need to realize that our mind can be scheduled into little thoughts or blocks of time that we didnâ€™t want to be used. We need to see ourselves in a new way. A sense of self-awareness that we can be persuaded. Next, we need to have a revival of technology. Once we realize this technology idea tugs us into all these different timelines and also can tug us into all these different emotions we can strive to make better changes that benefit us. Imagine redesigning that technology to work for our best interest and protecting us from those negative timelines. For example, you go online and post about a controversial topic, something that social media allows us to do which is an important thing to be able to express. Now instead of a comment section, thereâ€™s a button that is specially programmed to you so that you can react to this post thatâ€™s the best way for you. So, you click on the button above the controversial post and it says invite to dinner. Then you can send out an invitation to anyone that also wants to have dinner and talk about that topic. This creates a healthier way to discuss our disagreements and creates a positive environment, at your home with your friends over, talking about it. This is changing all the persuasive techniques with ideas that help us figure out what we want in life. Instead of handicapping our attention why not supplement our attention to create a powerful way to use our attention and have a powerful way to have the right conversations about society. The most important issues arenâ€™t these crazy futuristic changes but instead the issues that are right in front of our face. Something that is already changing a billion people thoughts. At the end of our lives all we have is time, how are we going to spend it?----Sam Lash--Sam Lash--1Unbecoming--764The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alex Mathers--220Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

After all, a coderâ€™s job is to write code (itâ€™s in the title!).Well, let me offer an alternative perspective: a software developerâ€™s role is not actually to write code at all. Code on its own, without a way to interact with it, without context or a clear imperative, is useless. Code for the sake of code can be fun or even educational but its place in the world is what makes it useful.So, if a coderâ€™s role is not to write code then what is it?Lets first consider another profession: the humble delivery driver, Bill. Is Billâ€™s role to drive? Well, the word â€œdriverâ€ is in the title but most of us know that a delivery driverâ€™s role is to deliver a package to its destination. The driving is not the goal, it is simply the means to get there.Bill may care deeply about what kind of car he drives, what music is playing and whether or not he supersizes his Coke at the McDonalds drive through. But you donâ€™t. You just want your package: on time and in one-piece.A software developerâ€™s role is to solve problems for users.For software to be useful it must have a purpose. Most often that purpose is to directly solve a userâ€™s problem (such as your accounting software). Other times the user problem that is being solved might not be so obvious â€” such as an encryption library or a control system for a satellite. But even in these cases there is a user need.If you look hard enough every piece of software will have a user need somewhere down the chain. The encryption library is intended to make key negotiation fast and secure so that users can maintain privacy online. The satellite control system makes sure your GPS continues to work so that Bill can find the nearest Maccas (and with the added bonus that the satellite doesnâ€™t crash into the Earth).Iâ€™ve come to start calling coders â€œProduct Developersâ€. Most of the developers I work with are solving needs for the users of our product at Expert360. By framing the role in this way the expectation starts to change. The developerâ€™s role is not to write code, itâ€™s to develop the product and solve problems for our users.Developers who realise the true nature of their role will see things differently. Where once they cared only about making fast code they now care about the feeling a user gets when a page loads in under 200ms; about the satisfying feeling a user gets when sheâ€™s notified of a payment; or of the excitement she feels when a simple notification alerts her to a new opportunity.Like the chef whoâ€™s job isnâ€™t to chop vegetables, the driver whoâ€™s job isnâ€™t to drive, the coderâ€™s job is not simply to code â€” itâ€™s so much more important than thatâ€¦:wq----VPE/CTO, Nerd, Coder and Producer of the forthcoming film, Debugging Diversity.Dan DraperinExpert360 Engineering--Dan Draper--2Dan DraperinExpert360 Engineering--Dan Draperin[Run]time--3The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alex Mathers--220Unbecoming--764Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

However, most of these fail to match up with the expectations from the global perspective and in terms of industry requirements. Most of the industry experts feel that the programs lack a pragmatic approach and hands-on practical exposure to real-world problems.This is one of the reasons why India lags behind many other countries when it comes to innovation. India has immense potential and a large pool of young talent with positive energy. But, we donâ€™t have the required platforms as well as opportunities to harness this energy and convert it into useful innovations. Although, India houses most of the global R&D centers and vibrant start-up ecosystem, what we lack is a progressive and ambitious education system that will create the required talent to drive innovation in the country. It is accepted globally that innovation is the need of the hour and we need innovative products, services and businesses to make this world a better place.It is innovation that converts a simple idea/insight into a tangible, fully-functional and marketable product or service. Technology adds functionality and convenience to the products/services whereas design makes the product consumer-centric. Thus, the fusion of design and technology leads to the development of products that are feasible, viable and desirable. There is a need for a program that encourages students to imagine new possibilities and make it real using a combination of technology, design and business.MIT ID has identified this need for Innovation professionals and has developed the unique Post-Graduate Innovation program. The program is first of its kind in India and essentially combines the best of design, engineering, liberal arts and management inputs.Through the innovation program, MITID aims to create innovators who can create value for the industry and society.This program is for candidates who want to shift from conventional thinking to experimental thinking and bring about a positive change. MIT ID Innovation Program instills creative mindset, confidence and innovation in each candidate and enables them to realize their full potential.The program allows each candidate to enhance their existing knowledge by developing a holistic approach to innovation. It enables students to understand the economic, political, social, technological and political trends.This 1-year postgraduate program is a unique blend of emerging technologies ( artificial intelligence, virtual reality, Internet-of-Things, Robotics, Cloud computing, etc ) with the new-age skills of design thinking, agile, rapid prototyping and concepts of branding, customer experience and business modeling.The curriculum for the program has been developed in consultation with young innovators, technology professionals, start-up founders and industry experts.The program is made for everyone who seeks a collaborative learning experience and is self-driven to build on their existing knowledge as well as develop new skill-sets and capabilities.It creates a breed of industry-ready engineers, designers, managers, technologists, strategists and entrepreneurs. It helps designers to bring their ideas to life in real-world; engineers to develop user-friendly products; managers in finding disruptive solutions; strategists in finding new business opportunities and technologists to commercialize the technology.The course is a substitute for traditional masters programs such as M.Des, MBA and M.Tech courses and is set to bring a paradigm shift in the education system. Unlike these courses, it focuses on the real-world application of the concepts and in the approach of learning-by-doing rather than just focussing on the theoretical topics.Innovation Program is a 50-week program that takes the students through multifaceted learning experiences including lectures, workshops, masterclasses, research trips, boot camps and a major project. It follows a practical approach where students gain hands-on experience followed by a major project where they have to exhibit the application of their classroom learning.The course is suitable for management, design, engineering, business and other graduates. It takes existing knowledge of the candidates as a foundation and enhances the spirit of innovation in them. The students can choose the theme of the program based on their interests and background.Immersion is an integral component of the entire program where each candidate is given ample time to introspect about their progress, learning and experiences. In this way, students embark on a journey of personal discovery so that they know where they stand in the world.For the first 30 weeks of the course, the candidates get trained by faculty members. These include industry experts, designers, innovators, entrepreneurs and technocrats. They impart industry-specific knowledge along with sharing their personal experiences. The projects span across different verticals including product design & development, business studies, human-centered design and research & development.The next 20 weeks are dedicated to the major project. In the major project, the students get a chance to apply their learning by delivering impactful, proactive and robust solutions.So, this program is definitely a boon for the aspiring entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, innovators and game-changers. After the program, MITIDâ€™s industry-ready candidates can fit into positions such as Innovation Lead, Technology Commercialization, Innovation Strategist, Product Development, R&D, Innovation Management, Design Management, Innovation Engineer, Entrepreneur, etc.----MIT ID Innovation Program is a 1-year program for self-driven and passionate individuals who aspire to create innovative products, services and businesses.MIT ID Innovation--MIT ID Innovation----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aaron Dinin, PhDinEntrepreneur's Handbook--8HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

The country has experienced serious socio-economic challenges for many years now. When I turned 16, 70% of Algeriaâ€™s population was under the age of 35 and more than 30% of the population was unemployed. There were no government job schemes, and having a university degree did not provide anyone any guarantees as to their future employment.Growing up in a conservative country like Algeria has obviously played a significant role in my career and journey.It compelled me to become an entrepreneur and focus on creating technology to provide financial services to people because I wanted to go against the stereotypes that are witnessed and felt daily, and truly contribute.Youâ€™re right, even today, going into tech as a woman is not an obvious choice: women are generally more conditioned by society to work in medicine or marketing. My first contact with technology was through my family: my father was a technology entrepreneur and I grew up in a very tech-oriented family.The pivotal point for me however, was the rise of the Internet. It transformed my life. When I was younger, my biggest database was an Encarta Encyclopaedia CD that I used for all my school homework, so being able to find some of the data on the web was amazing to me.This year, I will have been an entrepreneur for 8 years. My time and experience have taught me that to advance in any career, you need to have a combination of determination, skill, and luck. As an entrepreneur, these things are essential.Skills can be learned, luck is about recognising opportunities when they come, but determination is something no one can teach you. Itâ€™s the ability to keep going even if everyone thinks you and your ideas are crazy, stupid and donâ€™t seem likely to be successful.I donâ€™t think I would say Iâ€™ve been successful in my career thus far â€” I have a lot to do, and a lot to learn. But I know that the small victories Iâ€™ve experienced have been thanks to my determination. Trying and failing has always been my friend.Leaving Algeria and attending one of Franceâ€™s foremost engineering institutions was not easy. Many people told me that I was wasting my time, and would never succeed at such a high level, and in such a competitive space. But I was determined to prove them wrong, and did.After I graduated, I returned back to Algeria to launch my first business â€” a money transfer company that proved to be my first real taste of failure. But my experience led me to RedCloud and where I am today.To other young women embarking on a career in technology, I would say this:Make sure that your technical skills are unimpeachable.Unfortunately, gaps in your knowledge are not weighed the same as your male counterpartsâ€™. When your talents are undeniable, gender can become less of a concern.Itâ€™s my firm belief that coding and programming should be part of every school curriculum, but theyâ€™re not. If these things are not part of your degree course, youâ€™ll want to think about independent learning. Coding is not only about programming, but about the ability to think rationally and methodically in any context.The perception is that tech is an unsexy or boring area. It can be, when youâ€™re starting out â€” but when you mastering it, it becomes fascinating, and (most importantly) fun, so donâ€™t be put off. The industry is already full of opportunities, and more are being created daily.Tech shapes how we live. Itâ€™s doing more to contribute to humanityâ€™s advancement as a species than any other industry â€” and the more women on the frontlines the better.RedCloudâ€™s integrated digital finance platform enables anyone with a connected device to access financial products easily, and securely.

This age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution â€” or 4IR â€” is one of ultra-rapid change, and it has consequences â€” both positive and negative.As a leader, this pace requires you to make many more strategic decisions that are short-lived. According to the Boston Consulting Group, the average life of a business model was once fifteen years. By their estimation, that number has drastically reduced to five years. Likewise, research by the bank Credit Suisse revealed that the average amount of time a company spends in the Fortune 500 has diminished from sixty years to less than twenty. Such data suggests that even if you can rise to being one of the most successful companies in the world, it may not last.The methods companies used to succeed in the past are no longer enough. In 2017, a number of business periodicals began warning of a â€œretail apocalypse.â€ To some extent, they were correct. Companies that once netted immense profits have gone or are going out of business, or are being forced to pull back substantially. This includes enormous companies whose brands were household names, including Blockbuster, Kodak, Toys â€œRâ€ Us and RadioShack.These companies imploded because the world changed faster than they did. They couldnâ€™t evolve to keep pace with technological change and its effect on consumer habits. Itâ€™s not just about poor management or bad decision making â€” those have always existed. The sheer number of companies closing their doors is indicative of the change brought about by the 4IR.Revolutions also create entirely new opportunities. The 4IR is already witness to new start-up companies that are growing incredibly fast â€” on some occasions, going from zero to $1 billion valuations in only a few months. Facebook accumulated $1 billion in revenue in six years; Google, in only five. Instagram went from zero to a $1 billion valuation in fifteen months. From the moment I began working on this book until the time you held it in your hands, there were surely a few companies that were created and are now worth several billion dollars.This level of growth is not limited to the world of start-ups. Established companies are able to achieve this level of financial success as well â€” if they are able to learn and adapt.But how? How do you become a success story and not a cautionary tale in this new landscape?You must keep up with the speed of change. If you donâ€™t, youâ€™ll go the way of the dinosaurs of retail mentioned above. You have to make more strategic decisions, and you have to make them faster than ever before. The problem is that within this 4IR, the rules that you know for making strategic decisions are no longer enough. This is because the structure of the economy has changed. Managers need to look in new places for threats and find new sources for opportunities. In an age of rapid change, there is a price to pay for failure to notice how things are changing. Because this revolution is in its infancy, most people donâ€™t know where to look.So, how do organizations succeed during the 4IR?As a professor of entrepreneurship, executive educator, and advisor, I hear this question all the time. In the last year alone, Iâ€™ve worked with multinational companies, investors, consulting firms, international organizations, ministries, and other governmental organizations, start-up programs and, of course, educational institutions in a dozen countries on five continents. All want to know what they need to do for their organizations to remain successful in the face of this unprecedented change.So, I set out to answer that question.Of course, the question of what makes organizations successful is not new and has been persuasively answered before. But we are now entering a new era. So, I needed to find new answers.In my search for new answers, I examined the state of the art of academic research, which tends to lag behind the times, but has great theoretical rigor. Iâ€™ve analyzed reports by consulting companies, which tend to lack theory, but are rich in noteworthy cutting-edge case studies. Finally, Iâ€™ve engaged with people â€œin the field,â€ to understand what stands in their way of making sense of the coming change, to make sure I addressed the genuine concerns of my readers.In putting together my answer, I combined methodologies from business research and from the emerging discipline of future studies. Iâ€™ve examined over seventy case studies of multinationals, startups, and family businesses in multiple industries around the world. But case studies are mere signals of change. So, I dug deeper to uncover dozens of emerging trends. These are the aggregated patterns of change that describe many technologies, business models, and other similar signals. Yet, even these trends may be transient or declining. Therefore, I looked yet further to identify the deep drivers of these trends. Figure 1 clearly shows what these progressive levels of investigation mean.The result is CLEVER, a research-based framework of strategic drivers, the handful of underlying forces that cut across companies, industries, geographies, and trends.To learn more about how to succeed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, you can find CLEVER on Amazon.ALESSANDRO LANTERI, PhD is a professor of entrepreneurship at Hult International Business School in Dubai and London, and teaches executive education programs at ESCP Europe and SaÃ¯d Business School, University of Oxford.

They are trending and it wonâ€™t be changed in the coming years. The first thing to consider here is on which platform the app will work. Essentially, there are two major platforms that take the lead on the market â€” iOS and Android. So most businesses decide on building the app for both.But not everyone knows what comes further â€” which type of development to choose. The debates are going between native and cross-platform. There were times when native development took a significant lead while the business owner made the decision. Although now cross-platform becomes more and more popular. Why would that be?Letâ€™s consider the advantages of each one of these approaches and make the right choice!Native apps are built using programming languages that are native to a specific operating system. These are Kotlin and Java for Android and Swift along with Objective-C for iOS. Among such apps are mail client, calendar, alarm clock and other basic programs that go with each OS by default. Having the access to all deviceâ€™s features and services they give users a smoother UX performance.The key benefits of native apps are:A simple and understandable interface of native apps attracts users due to being similar to the one OS has. The result is positive user experience and willingness to use it repeatedly.Being installed by default gives them full access to all necessary data when offline. Thatâ€™s opposite to web apps that are dependant on the network connection and speed. If you need to develop a mobile game, native app development is the best fit.Excellent performance plus easy-to-use specifics make a great impact on the App Store and Google Play rankings. This leads to bigger visibility and greater revenue.The update process and new features integration go smoother and faster on native apps.Although, native app development requires creating apps separately for each platform which leads to major extending the projectâ€™s time and cost estimation.Cross-platform development literally means building apps that easily run on multiple operating systems. Such apps are easier to be developed than native ones. There are several frameworks participate in their development process: React Native, Xamarin, etc.Letâ€™s see their key benefits:There is a well-known slogan that characterizes probably the most important approach developers use: â€œwrite once, run anywhereâ€. Which means that a single code can be applied to multiple platforms. Besides that only one team develops the apps for all major platforms. This is how the development cost and time are less compared to the one native apps require.There is no need for developers to learn a large scope of different programming languages or technologies. Just a few is enough. The initial deployment on most platforms goes faster. As well as future changes are mostly provided simultaneously without the need to make them on each platform separately.When native apps target only one platform, cross-platform apps aim at multiple ones. Thus the userbase gets bigger within a shorter period of time. Which is an obvious advantage for small businesses and leads to increased revenues.The specifics of UI and UX in cross-platform development is that they are rendered with native controls. So design performance is pretty close to native.Taking into account all the above and even more, cross-platform apps are a great choice when you need:The most popular and highly-performing framework that solves the most complex tasks while developing cross-platform apps is React Native. The number of the already existing apps created with it grows hugely. They cover different industries: food delivery, chatting, e-commerce, audio processing, etc. Lots of them have already received great feedbacks due to high-performance feature.Letâ€™s get to know some of the most popular apps that turned out to be created with React Native from the very beginning or at some part.#1. Facebook Ads ManagerThis is the first full cross-platform app created with React Native by Facebook. It has a clear interface, intuitive UX, user-friendly navigation, flawless transitions while perfectly handling different ads formats, currencies, time zones, etc.#2. BloombergIt shows global business and finance news to users. Interesting fact: Bloomberg development team before adopting React Native created apps for iOS and Android separately. That took significant amounts of time. Simultaneous update for both platforms turned out to be a serious argument.#3. UberEatsIt serves as a dashboard for restaurants with features including sound and push notifications. Covering a small part of the app React Native adds great UI/UX experience. More to that, the team had experience with React so transitioning to React Native was fast and easy.#4. GyroscopeThis app is integrated with the HealthKit, thus it tracks the steps, distance, heart rate and shows the data about userâ€™s activities including weight loss, meditation, running, productivity, etc. A user can choose the most convenient way that the data can be displayed. A user can also see own progress with reports and plan future healthcare development.#5. TeslaAnother well-trusted company has made its choice on React Native technology while developing its mobile applications both for Android and iOS. Taking into account that Tesla always chooses the best solutions for any sphere, this app is built specifically for users of Tesla vehicles and Powerwall. And it doesnâ€™t matter whether youâ€™re using the Android or iOS versions, both of them have all the same functions to control and monitor your vehicle, such as the charger, lights, horn, locks, or the panoramic roof, etc.Ð¡ross-platform apps continue evolving into a much better solution in many ways, therefore, taking the winning positions compared to native development. Now they are more like native apps in UI/UX performance and continue widening their horizons.Although the competition is still there and so far many challenges ahead. Nowadays more and more respective companies choose React Native for a less cost and time-consuming mobile apps development with similar quality.If youâ€™re guessing how the development process with React Native goes, check our comprehensive approach and make the first step!If you liked this, show your support by clapping us to share with other people on Medium.Follow us on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Behance, Medium and visit our corporate blog for more news and articles on smart solutions.Any questions?

PlongÃ©e dans des solutions innovantes pensÃ©es pour rÃ©inventer les mÃ©thodes dâ€™apprentissage, le systÃ¨me Ã©ducatif ou lâ€™insertion des jeunes diplÃ´mÃ©s dans le monde professionnelEdtech contre le reste du monde (de lâ€™Ã©ducation) : le choc culturelÂ« Nous suivons des start-up qui transforment le monde de lâ€™Ã©ducation et cherchons, avec elles, des solutions pour crÃ©er de la valeur Â», explique Michel Coster, directeur de lâ€™AccÃ©lÃ©rateur emlyon business school en ouverture du premier lâ€™ EdJobTech Day. Â« Nous voulons aider les entrepreneurs Ã  avoir une vision. Â» renchÃ©rit Virginie Boissimon-Smolders, directrice adjointe de lâ€™accÃ©lÃ©rateur. Ã€ se demander rÃ©ellement pourquoi ils ont dÃ©cidÃ© de crÃ©er une entreprise. Â»Comprendre et cerner les attentes des potentiels utilisateurs est lâ€™un des enjeux majeurs[UMO1] pour les entrepreneurs des Edtech, souvent Ã©loignÃ©s naturellement de certains acteurs de leur propre marchÃ©. Des passerelles restent Ã  construire pour rÃ©duire lâ€™Ã©cart culturel entre le monde de lâ€™Ã©ducation au sens strict, parfois mÃ©fiant face Ã  certaines innovations, et celui des Edtech, dÃ©sireux de casser les codes. Un choc des cultures et des mentalitÃ©s, qui a aussi des consÃ©quences pour le business. Difficile en effet de proposer des solutions payantes Ã  des professeurs du primaire et du secondaire, ce qui implique de trouver dâ€™autres sources de financements !Â« Câ€™est la principale difficultÃ© pour les Edtech, analyse Virginie Boissimon-Smolders. Des adaptations sont nÃ©cessaires des deux cÃ´tÃ©s. Nous incitons vivement les entrepreneurs Ã  comprendre cette diffÃ©rence de culture. Â» Comment ? En leur expliquant les rouages, les arcanes, les diffÃ©rentes strates de dÃ©cision de lâ€™Ã©ducation nationale. Â« Si la vie dâ€™un entrepreneur est un marathon, celle dâ€™un entrepreneur dans la Edtech est un ironman Â», complÃ¨te Marie-Christine Levet, fondatrice du fonds dâ€™investissements Educapital, premier fond europÃ©en dÃ©diÃ© aux Edtech. Pour elle, le marchÃ© de lâ€™Ã©ducation serait mÃªme lâ€™un des plus laborieux du monde !Plus globalement, les edtech doivent dÃ©montrer leur capacitÃ© Ã  grandir pour intÃ©resser les investisseurs. Et pour gagner en puissance, les start-up doivent crÃ©er des modÃ¨les exportables Ã  lâ€™Ã©tranger, ce qui est rarement le cas. Comme le confirme Maximilien Bacot, de Breega Capital : Â« Les projets doivent Ãªtre mieux financÃ©s, et cela passera sans doute par le regroupement des diffÃ©rentes initiatives. Nous avons rÃ©ussi Ã  construire la start-up nation, maintenant nous devons construire la scale-up nation.â€De Digischool Ã  Unly, les belles promesses de la ed techSi le secteur sâ€™avÃ¨re difficile dâ€™accÃ¨s, plusieurs start-up connaissent un succÃ¨s indÃ©niable. Câ€™est notamment le cas de DigiSchool, une plateforme dâ€™aide aux devoirs qui compte 12 millions de connexions mensuelles, 200 salariÃ©s et un chiffre dâ€™affaires de plus de 5 millions dâ€™euros. Ou encore de Woonoz dont lâ€™objectif premier, en 2005, consistait Ã  offrir une remise Ã  niveau en orthographe. Lâ€™entreprise compte aujourdâ€™hui 5 millions dâ€™utilisateurs et dÃ©veloppe des solutions basÃ©es sur les neuroscience pour proposer un service dâ€™apprentissage entiÃ¨rement personnalisÃ©.En plus de ces deux figures de proue lyonnaises, plusieurs structures en devenir ont Ã©tÃ© invitÃ©es Ã  pitcher leurs idÃ©es pour lâ€™Edjobtech Day. Câ€™est le cas de Holy Owly, une solution qui encourage lâ€™apprentissage de lâ€™anglais Ã  des enfants Ã¢gÃ©s de 3 ans Ã  11 ans, ou encore Illini, une plateforme dâ€™apprentissage de langue avec une mÃ©thode pÃ©dagogique originale : elle sâ€™appuie sur des vidÃ©os du quotidien. De son cÃ´tÃ©, Unly, cherche Ã  favoriser la diversitÃ© dans lâ€™enseignement supÃ©rieur.VoilÃ  pour la edtech. CÃ´tÃ© Jobtech, HPI sâ€™emploie par exemple Ã  mesurer la qualitÃ© de vie au travail. Â« GrÃ¢ce Ã  nos dix premiers clients, nous avons pu lever 500 000 euros et afficher un premier chiffre dâ€™affaires de 200 000 euros Â»,explique lâ€™un des fondateurs venu prÃ©senter son projet au Edjobtech day. Dâ€™autres encore mettent en place des solutions pour aider les professionnels en reconversion via Ã  un compagnon dâ€™apprentissage intelligent (Inokufu).Un rÃ©seau de soutien aux entrepreneurs ed et job techPour les aider dans leur progression, lâ€™accÃ©lÃ©rateur a mis en place un systÃ¨me de mentorat, illustrÃ©e au Edjobtech day par la prÃ©sence dâ€™Alexandre Pachulski : le fondateur de Talentsoft, star parisienne des logiciels RH, est ainsi venu distiller ses inspirations pour motiver les entrepreneurs prÃ©sentâ€¦ Jusque dans ses citations du Â« Seigneur des Anneaux Â».Â« Câ€™est important dâ€™avoir des retours dâ€™expÃ©rience Â», note Virginie Boissimon-Smolders. Les fondateurs de DigiSchool Anthony Kuntz et de Woonoz Fabrice Cohen font dâ€™ailleurs partie de ce rÃ©seau dâ€™entraide. Un moyen pour ces entrepreneurs aguerris de partager leurs rÃ©ussites, mais aussi de rappeler le sens social qui doit guider toute initiative innovante en matiÃ¨re dâ€™Ã©ducation.Â« On ne doit pas perdre de vue que lâ€™Homme est au centre de ces technologies Â», complÃ¨te Michel Coster.

Your smartphone will be able to recognize youFor years, device makers have been searching for ways to ramp up device security while allowing users to bypass that pesky PIN. Several devices now feature fingerprint or iris scanners, both of which are known to be hackable.Initial experiments in facial recognition were also underwhelming, as this technology could be deceived by a photo of the userâ€™s face. New and emerging facial recognition technology doesnâ€™t just scan facial features, rather also scans the contours of an individualâ€™s face and head, making the software much harder to trick.Facial recognition could become the new and perfect example for device unlocking, but as smartphone sensors continue to develop, your phone might ultimately identify you without scanning you. Rather, it will look for other unique characteristics, like the tone of voice, the way one moves or the pattern of their typing.2. Shifting realityJust think of shopping online and being able to look through your phone to see exactly how that new table would look in your office, or how the new jacket would look like on your son or daughter.Augmented reality (AR) has already been featured in the gaming world, but the future technology of smartphones could take AR mainstream in industries such as retail, tech-support and healthcare.Many mobile device makers have already released AR tool kits for mobile app development. The tool kits allow app developers to access a deviceâ€™s camera and motion sensors and create apps that lay digital objects on top of the cameraâ€™s live view and move them around with accuracy.As this technology continues to evolve, the next step is that smartphones donâ€™t just capture and alter images but also project them into the real world. Digital projectors and holographic displays are already in development, but it will likely be several years before this technology is economical and reliable enough for large-scale use.3. Durable, flexible or even foldable phonesIn a few years, it will become very difficult to snap your phone, and you might finally be able to fold it up and put it in your pocket.Macworld recently reported that device makers are also experimenting with new ways to strengthen the glass used for the displays of the smartphone. Some wearable devices already use sapphire glass, and researchers are making notable breakthroughs on self-healing screens and even more durable material called graphene glass.4. Advancements in chargingBattery life on mobile phones has always been a chief complaint among consumers. With each new model, manufacturers attempt to upgrade the battery, but they also attach faster processors, which consume extra energy.To solve this problem, device manufacturers are experimenting with various kinds of likely solutions such as nanobatteries, hydrogen fuel cells, solar power or kinetic energy meaning that the phone will charge as one moves around.Nonetheless, in the future phoneâ€™s battery, it will certainly charge quicker and probably wirelessly, excluding the need for a charging port. Some device makers have already made it possible to charge latest devices wirelessly, however, the ports still remain. That will likely change in the coming years as consumers become more habitual to wireless charging and as coffee shops and other businesses begin to install wireless charging units for customer usage.5. Virtual buttons & virtual assistantsCompanies have been expanding screen size for years, but the smartphones of the future will likely be all screen, with display capabilities on the front, back and sides of the device. It means that there will be no physical buttons, including a home button.As the device becomes more virtual and streamlined, the same will happen with the user interface. Virtual assistants will take on an important role, helping one navigate through the phone and apps and personalizing the home screen based on patterns. Because of the advances in artificial intelligence, these assistants have also grown to be smarter and more intuitive.----A Passionate Writer with love for Technology.

Itâ€™s converting an idea into a different idea or an updated one through merging another idea into it, so we end up with one new big idea. Itâ€™s been happening for years, but more rapidly now, with all the new technological developments.Like every other business, the media businesses have been affected by convergence. In media, convergence generally means, merging the communication outlets with technology through various platforms. Newspapers are now online and offer videos, TV stations offer interactive chats and VOD and radio are streaming with webcams. The digital era forced the media industry to change in the way it distributes its content and even its business models. In some ways the merge was subtle and in other ways it was disruptive.Innovation Innovation Innovation and innovationThere are four types of technology changes, categoriezed in innovations that lead to convergence; incremental, architectural, discontinuous and disruptive. Every industry has faced at least one type of these innovations if not all. Incremental is the basic one out of the four. It enhances the product and increases consumer satisfaction. It is usually an update in interface or design, making the product more user friendly. An example would be, how the TV stations have moved away from airing SD content and are now airing content in HD. Giving the audience a better viewing experience, by offering them better image quality. However incremental innovation is always at high risk of turning obsolete by disruptive innovations.On the other hand, architectural innovation is enhancing the product in a way that it will widen the target market and audience. If the target audience were females only, it would now be able to attract male audiences. If the company were targeting older audiences it now would be able to also target the younger generations. An architectural change could also help the company to change from a B2B market to a B2C market. Appleâ€™s Apple watch was able to achieve this several times, when it first launched it was targeting young digital enthusiastic, a tech savy market audience. It then released a hermes edition, targeting a different market, a more sophisticated audience, by collaborating with a high brand, using their target audience and diverting them to apple. On its next release, apple released a Nike edition, targeting athletes and fitness-oriented audience. In its final release, it released a function that can detect a fall, blood pressure and many more health related problems. Allowing the product to automatically send GPS location and call the local police. Simultaneously the product was able to yearly expand its market and able to reach a different target audience.A discontinuous innovation is a major change in the technological structure and a production of the business model or product. It is a technology shift in the product capabilities that renders the current system obsolete. Handwritten newspapers, antenna broadcasting, and non-linear editing are some examples of a change in the technology structure in the media industry that have lead models or products to be obsolete, with many more to come. people in the industry believe that soon enough, there will be no printed newspapers; TV channels will be airing over the Internet and no longer using broadcasting satellites.The final innovation is disruptive, and as the name implies, this type of innovation causes a dramatic change by introducing groundbreaking products that transforms the existing market, and branches off and creates new markets with no one to fight with for market share. Disruptive models are more affordable, convenient and simpler. Netflix is todayâ€™s greatest example of disruptive innovation. Netflix algorithm was disruptive to DVD industry by allowing people to binge watch, without having the hassle to go to the store to rent or return the movie. Netflix is now also competing with TV stations by diverting their audience into Netflix new created market space.Convergence has completely changed the way we consume data. However is media convergence good for the industry?----1Reem Alieh--Reem Alieh--1Reem Alieh--1Reem Alieh--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Scott H.

The set of principles which not only help guide us in our every day lives but also help companies build products, hire employees and scale up. In the early days of Breathe Life, it was crucial to me and the other Founders that we establish a set of values which we would adhere to as we grew from the four of us to ten or twenty or more.One of the hardest parts, after one has established values, is the ability to follow through with themâ€¦So what better way to hold ourselves and our team accountable than to publicize these values, what they mean to us and how we plan to follow them?When we set out to establish these values we knew we wanted 5 core ones, we wanted them to be straightforward, easy to understand and easy to live. We wanted to be able to, at any point in our future, ask our team if the values apply to their every day and have everyone nod their head and agree that thatâ€™s how we guide our work and our decision-making. We didnâ€™t want to be a company that had 15+ different values to adhere to that new employees would easily forget. We also knew they needed to be scalable. Sure we were four people when we established them, but we needed them to still be relevant and easy to apply years down the line as we scaled up. I strongly believe that the 5 values we settled on perfectly represent how myself, Arach, JN and Seb work and what we believe in and, for that matter, how all 13 Breathe Life employees work.Our 5 values are Human, Trusting, Proactive, Resourceful and Playful, but to kick off this 5 part series on them, letâ€™s begin with our first value â€” to be Human.What exactly does this mean to Breathe Life?It means that we expect ourselves and our team to work and interact in ways that are authentic, humble and honest. The exact daily implementation of it varies based on who you ask. Personally, I see this value as being crucial for building a team where everyone is happy and comfortable being themselves. What I mean by this is that everyone genuinely enjoys being in office, what theyâ€™re working on and who theyâ€™re working with. However, Seb, who is our Chief Product Officer, looks at this value from a product design standpoint.â€œWe need to always remember that our technology serves people, real people, and in this regard, it needs to be relevant and accessible to all so everybody can use it and benefit from it.â€The view of this value varies again when asking Kenza, who is on the engineering team. She sees Being Human as facilitating a strong and understanding working environment within the team.â€œItâ€™s crucial that everyone on the engineering team is able to not only be humble in asking for help when they need it, but they also need to be honest when reviewing each otherâ€™s code, itâ€™s the only way to ship amazing products in a timely manner.â€Although this value is represented in different ways to different people, at its core itâ€™s all about humanity. Itâ€™s about working well together, being happy and comfortable within the team and never forgetting that there are real people who need and use our products.To be Human is the first value we impart on new team members and is the one we consider to be the most important. I truly believe that you cannot scale a team unless all members practice authenticity, honesty and are humble. And it begins at the top, as Founders, we believe deeply in transparency and in always be open with our team members. They know they can hold us to the highest standards when it comes to being human with them.Have you or your team implemented values? Iâ€™d love to hear about how other companies are doing it and what impacted it has had on them as they scaled.Stay tuned for next week when I delve into our second value â€” to be trusting.-Ian Jeffrey, Co-Founder & CEO of Breathe Life----ZinniaWe power exceptional insurance experiences for one and all.ZinniainZinnia--Janic BeauchemininZinnia--Kenza IrakiinZinnia--1ZinniainZinnia--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Scott H.

Since I discover Project WOC, a beautiful synergy started building around it, adding more trips, more countries, tons of knowledge, and many more new people to meet.WOC made me step out of my comfort zone and incite motion, looking for more information about technology, blockchain, and innovations. I saw a spark of an opportunity capable of changing the world.That spark was so bright that I knew it could light up more lives than just mine. Time has passed as a shooting star. This new blockchain application is about to change plenty of things, just as Bitcoin did and keep doing. Although almost everything evolves through time, so do the Blockchain.This blog has never been about me, although I am part of this great team; Slim is hard to reach, he calls me randomly to share the progress of WOC, heâ€™s been giving me a lot more information.The last time we spoke, he shared with me a list of pending tasks that are going to be the first tasks on WOC. The list is quite long; they are looking for developers in blockchain and node.js and marketing people mostly.I identified a couple of tasks I was capable of getting done. That list was my entrance ticket to Project WOC. My â€œGolden Ticketâ€ I like to call it.He told me, the launch date for WOC should be, by January of 2020, if everyone does its job and deliver on time.I firmly believe that Music is a global language; it is present all around the world since ancient times. Music unifies people just like Techno Music did after the Berlin Wall falls, and like Queen did in 1985 at the â€œLive Aidâ€ concert at Wembley, and so many more bands do in music festivals and concerts, we want to gather as many people as possible for a World-Class show of innovation.In this innovation festival so far, there are 14 people from different places. I have the task to keep a private group alive with all of them on Telegram.We ended up finding a name for Canadians, Mexicans, Indians, Ukrainian, and a Netherland friend.A USA guy also joined in the last few days. So our band names ended up like: The Maples, The Spicy Tacos, The Patels, The Kiev, The Red Tulips and The Apprentice (he rejected that last one because you recalled the Trump Reality Show â€œThe Apprenticeâ€) and insisted we find another name, at the end he started enjoying the name.Everyone was laughing when I mentioned it for the first time. For a couple of weeks, Iâ€™ve been chatting with each of them; they are extraordinary people, humble, talented, and curious.I will do an exceptional blog about the Band members just so you get to know them better.For my part, I secretly call them The Stratotchiâ€™s in relation to Satoshi Nakamoto and the Master Violin crafter Antonius Stradivarius. I would say that group sounds pretty inspired by them, because of the technology and the masterpiece the band is crafting.After a few discussions, I understood why they are part of WOC; we share the mindset, the values, and the purpose behind this collaboration. Each of us is in a way connected now, like in a hero movie, everyone has a unique skill that adds value to the team and the project itself.One thing I didnâ€™t share with you thus far is that everyone has kept their identity confidential. Although I am not sure, I think Slim had a connection with each of them before they join. They already have the hackerâ€™s mentality to stay away from mentioning their private information.On my part, Iâ€™m getting the position of Public Relations and Communication with the team. I like the duties I will have at this role.They were waiting for someone who didnâ€™t give a sh**t about being one of the public spokespeople, I mean sooner or later somebody should do it; I am honored to be that person.This is the last part of my interview with Slim, the first Cypherpunk Iâ€™ve met, and my favorite one thus far. I had more questions than at the beginning of this story, most related to the future.Whatâ€™s behind â€œProject WOCâ€? In my next blog I will reveal much more information, such as its real name. Keep posted! Let your curiosity grow, and if an idea comes to your mind, write it down.If you want to be the earliest members part of this Movement, contact me!The story doesnâ€™t finish here. It is about to start! You can be part of this chain, become one more character of this great adventure.16-. How would you describe WOC?Like the powerful engine of a mighty train, that will take us to an excellent destination.17-. Is WOC an easy way to success?No, for sure not. It is a way to excel. People have to manage their project from beginning to end. Participants have to be on time in their work or material delivery. So everyone has to communicate to make it successfully to the end of a project.18-. What will be needed to be part of it?An Idea, A skill or a Material you process.19-. Is WOC somehow selective with its members?The way our algorithm work is based on user perspective and how they value projects, the more the community is interested in a project, the more exposure it gets, and better suppliers join the group. We have no selection committees deciding if your idea might be a good fit and might perform, users, determine if your idea is worth it. Users are also taken in a rigorous process to show off their profile (with bio, photos, videos, etc.) in the most professional way so innovators will aspire to collaborate with them.20-. What should I do to be part of the Band?It would be best if you got involved and be prepared to support our effort to change things and remove barriers making peoples life harder in the current system. Show your interest and join our Telegram groups, Like our page.21- Is WOC for everyone?Absolutely Yes, but the right question should be everyone ready for WOC?, And the answer to this is No, Woc will not work for lazy people, fraudsters, scammers, slackers; You know all the ones that think they can get away with mediocrity.22- Can we say you are the director/president of WOC?No, we canâ€™t say this, as WOC need no human input to run correctly, it is not a company nor does it belong to anyone. It was invented to perform its task; Help human collaborate easily to create things they need quickly. I do just like you and do the job that is listed on the board to help it grow. Sometimes my task is to add more new ones to the platform too.The Evolution of the Blockchain is yet to come, to bring the best of Human Kind !!!Donâ€™t forget to â€œCLAPâ€ this article, share it with your friends, follow me on Medium, Instagram: @eov.cwb and Twitter: @emmov360----Â·Mexican Entrepreneur, Rookie Writer, passionate about Photography, Innovation, Space, Science, and Technology.

Are you always willing to lend an ear to your co-workerâ€™s latest band practice drama, or would you prefer to keep conversations at the corporate level?A recent survey conducted for the 2018 State of Workplace Empathy reported that a whopping 96% of respondents rated empathy as an important quality for companies to demonstrate. Despite this, 92% of employees believe that empathy remains undervalued at their company, which is an increase from results in prior years.Empathy is described as not just understanding another personâ€™s perspective, but truly putting yourself in their shoes and feeling those emotions alongside that person. Itâ€™s a cornerstone of emotional intelligence, and when a workplace demonstrates empathy, there are countless studies that correlate it to increased happiness, productivity, and retention amongst employees.So more empathy at work is wanted, and many people feel empathetic, but the practice isnâ€™t effectively translating into reality. This disconnect is further exacerbated by the rise of remote work, which removes much of the face-to-face interactions of a traditional office.Remote work, by definition, removes the need for colleagues to be co-located in one place. This means that those small, impromptu social interactions donâ€™t necessarily happen organically the way they would in an office kitchen or social space. These informal conversations are great ways to connect and demonstrate empathy at work, and for remote teams this process needs to be more intentional.A lack of empathy may be having a serious negative impact on your remote team, which, if not corrected, can break down team dynamics and lead to burnout, loss of productivity, and turnover. Letâ€™s look at a few examples of remote team disparities that can lead to an unintentional lack of empathy, and how to spot these scenarios before they impact your relationships with your teammates:Letâ€™s take the simple fact of geography: if you have a remote team that is located in New York, Chicago, Texas, and California, chances are that come January, thereâ€™s going to be a real mixed bag of emotions.The weather is miserable in Chicago in January; they literally call it #Chiberia. Meanwhile, folks in Texas might be whistling dixie, enjoying the escape from oppressive summer heat.Image Source: The GuardianFor some, these weather-induced mood changes are clinical. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that occurs primarily in fall and winter months, and is believed to be caused by a lack of sun due to shorter daylight during this time of the year. This phenomenon causes decreased levels of serotonin, thus bringing down the mood of a suffering individual. Even if someone isnâ€™t suffering from SAD, living in a temporary tundra is known to invoke general feelings of malaise.Being conscious of the differing experiences of your colleagues can go a long way in understanding why energy levels might not match up with the sun schedule in your own timezone.Do: Try to keep the mood light (and bright â˜€ï¸) in chat by posting funny tweets or memes.Donâ€™t: Lament the â€œlack of energyâ€ and coax people to put on a fake smile. Itâ€™s disingenuous and runs the risk of giving people the impression that their true feelings are not welcome. By all means, avoid starting video calls and meetings with a full report of the weather. Letâ€™s leave that to the meteorologists.In addition to geography, there are also natural forces to consider. The weather might be generally terrific in California, but those folks sadly encounter other disruptive elements, like forest fires and drought. Another fair weather area, Houston, Texas, was recently devastated by a hurricane.If youâ€™re based in New York City and you are on a remote team, you might come into work thinking itâ€™s a normal day, whereas your coworker is petrified that their family and friends are being evacuated from their homes.Even though many of these events are easily discoverable via news outlets, itâ€™s not always obvious to draw these connections to a person youâ€™re interacting with at work. Thatâ€™s where the need for empathy comes into play.Do: Foster a culture of sharing context within your team by allowing folks to bring their whole selves to work. When someone opens up about trials in their community, make sure that person feels heard. Ask about opportunities to help. Hosting a monthly team bonding meeting that doesnâ€™t revolve around project updates and strategy can be a great opportunity to allow your remote team to share other aspects of their lives with the group.Donâ€™t: Put those people on the spot in a meeting and ask them to share, or make light of their experience. If youâ€™re not sure if they want to talk about it, reach out to them privately in an asynchronous medium like chat or email.There are a myriad of normal human conditions that can be extremely disruptive to a personâ€™s ability to engage at work:Demonstrating empathy for your colleagues in these circumstances allows you to respect their boundaries, and understand why sometimes they need to prioritize other aspects of their life outside of the 9 to 5.Do: Be understanding when circumstances out of a personâ€™s control come up. Things happen sometimes. Treat others how you would want to be treated.Donâ€™t: Fault that person for their life circumstances: for example not putting them on a project, or calling them out for their absences in a group setting.This is an interesting one, especially considering politics are one of the most taboo topics in the workplace. In the modern workforce, however, teams donâ€™t just span states, but also countries.For example, most Americans remain largely unaware and unaffected by Brazilâ€™s recent, contentious presidential election. Meanwhile, the ordeal would have been distracting and draining for a colleague based there.Itâ€™s not just politics as usual, either. Humanitarian crises happen in many countries across the world, and if you have colleagues based in other countries, itâ€™s more important to pay attention to the happenings of their home base.Itâ€™s difficult to empathize when you are largely uninformed of the ramifications of a situation that has absolutely nothing to do with you. Out of sight out of mind, right? But if itâ€™s affecting your colleague, it will inevitably affect you, too.Do: Make it known to those people that you are following the news in their area, and you are available to talk.Donâ€™t: Offer your own (most likely uninformed) opinion on the subject. Allow those who are in the thick of things their own space to speak freely.Itâ€™s always important to constantly challenge yourself to demonstrate empathy at your workplace, especially if youâ€™re remote. But demonstrating empathy can sometimes backfire ðŸ˜–Compassion fatigue is a phenomenon where people become overwhelmed after repeated exposure to the suffering of others. It is categorized by numbness and even, at times, depression. The utter exhaustion of interfacing emotionally with unfortunate circumstances is enough to burn out even a person who is just observing from the sidelines.Desensitization is the enemy of empathy, so educate yourself on the signs and symptoms of compassion fatigue, and take a step back when you need to. Be open with your colleagues about how youâ€™re feeling.Another red flag to keep an eye out for is unconscious bias towards showing empathy for some groups of people and not others. According to research done at Harvard University, the lower portion of the brain, called the medial prefrontal cortex (MFPC) is the portion of the brain that is active when humans are exhibiting signs of empathy.Researchers found that the MFPC was highly engaged when participants were discussing people they considered like-minded to them, but didnâ€™t register activity when discussing those perceived as unlike them in areas like political affiliation and region of origin.Itâ€™s important to keep unconscious bias in mind, particularly in a remote workplace, when youâ€™re chatting and working with your co-workers. If you find yourself showing empathy for some colleagues but not others, ask yourself if there is an underlying reason that might be happening. Are you a parent, thus showing empathy for other parents? Do you live in a warm place all year, thus seemingly unaware of the struggles of those long winter months?Remember that empathy is a cornerstone of a positive workplace culture, and demonstrating an understanding of the experiences of your colleagues is a great way to foster community, even on a remote team.Ask yourself how you are currently demonstrating empathy in your workplace, and come up with ways to amplify your contributions. A mile in someone elseâ€™s shoes can feel like a quick trip when you plan, pack your bag with some empathetic tools, and of course, wear comfy shoes.Good or bad, weâ€™d love to hear your thoughts.

447,3162,https://medium.com/@richmondpapers/robots-wont-take-our-jobs-sorta-c88df54d6266?source=tag_archive---------66-----------------------,Robots wonâ€™t take our jobsâ€¦ sorta.,None,Stephen John Richmond (The Richmond Papers),https://medium.com/,3,0,0,"Stephen John Richmond (The Richmond Papers)Follow--ListenSharePeople like to speculate a lot on whether AI and better robotics will make human workers redundant (figuratively and literally) or at least a large percentage of us. Some say weâ€™re doomed once the robots get too advanced and some say theyâ€™ll always be new jobs created.So what will actually happen?Well, letâ€™s take this to its logical extreme. Letâ€™s assume a robot is created that is capable of literally anything a human can do and it can do all those tasks better than any individual human can. Yes, that includes creative tasks like writing plays or playing the violin. It is literally every task. Yes, even that exception you have in your head right now, that one too.The question we should be asking is- how much do these robots cost to make and how quickly can that be done?Because just because we are able to create these extraordinary robots in this scenario it doesnâ€™t follow that we then have an infinite number of them. We have the number of them we are currently able to produce plus any we have already produced. (Subject to maintenance.)So we shouldnâ€™t be modelling this as an employer simply always switching to the robot in every case. We should instead think of it as capital being able to add additional hyper-high skilled workers to the pool of workers in existence. What has changed is not a shift from one mode of production (humans) to another (robots) but instead an expansion of the labour pool. What happens with a larger pool of workers relative to demand? Usually lower wages. Itâ€™s important to note that the robots donâ€™t create new demand beyond maintenance, thatâ€™s very different to migrants. Migrants increase the labour pool but also the demand for goods and services and so tend not to lower wages. Robots can and will. There is also a risk that they will ultimately result in unemployment because the supply of jobs is limited by what capital- land, raw materials, existing capital stock (factories and other buildings, machines, etc.) are required for that job to be completed. If the cost of labour plus the capital cost is greater than the sale price then private industry will never purchase that labour.This gets a little complicated though because prices can also alter. Prices can only remain high if there is demand for those goods and services and so someone somewhere has to be purchasing them. Therefore the most likely result is that those who already have capital stock will be able to significantly expand it via these robots compared to people entirely reliant on their labour to generate income. Those wealthy people can only consume so much though so itâ€™s reasonable to assume that prices will adjust to wages sufficiently for workers to be able to buy some bare basics in goods and services (although thereâ€™s no reason to believe that would be true of literally everyone but some presumably would be in that situation). Instead, we would see ever increasing inequality of wealth but also increasing inequality of consumption where the wealthy could afford extraordinary extravagances while wage labour would barely be able to eat. There would likely still be some jobs around the edges though where use could be made of human labour, even if it were of inferior quality, due to a lack of sufficient robots to complete all the desired tasks. So itâ€™s grim but we donâ€™t all get replacedâ€¦ hurrah?(Fyi you solve literally every bad part of this with a basic income. Just sayinâ€™.)----My attempt to understand policy and economics.

The Sessia platform utilizes opportunities where the majority of people spend most of their time accessing social media. Social media is considered an appropriate and very strategic location for businesses to promote the products and services they provide. Social media is also considered to be very economical in creating advertisements because there is no need to spend a large amount of money even free. Today, business people tend to direct their business to be published through social media because of these benefits. They do not need to spend a lot of money to advertise their products and of course they have a longer duration. Through social media, each user can access and view the products being traded. To order, the process is also not difficult and fast. This is a special concern for the Sessia platform to create its own social media focused on its use in the business scope with additional supporting facilities.Sessia creates social media applications that are very flexible and can be used by every business person. The many features possessed by this platform are predicted to be able to attract millions of new users into the ecosystem. Sessia is the first digital platform that provides benefits to users in the form of cashback and kickback. Every user who makes a product purchase transaction through Sessia will be entitled to receive cashback. Not only one user, but millions of Sessia users have the right to accept this opportunity. Then how do users get cashback and kickback?Sessia provides many types of products and services that cover various types of businesses in its social media applications. Users can freely choose whatever product they want. When a user buys a product, the Sessia system will automatically post it into that userâ€™s account. This post contains the type of product purchased and the name of the producer and proof of payment placed next to each other. These posts can be liked, commented on, recommended, shared, and other users can also buy the same product just by clicking the â€œbasketâ€ or â€œpurchaseâ€ button available at the bottom of the post. Sessia social media users can also see the number of KICKS tokens, official digital tokens issued by Sessia, obtained by these users. This post will only appear in user accounts after they have paid the payment. Users can easily buy products that are the same as the desired amount. When there are other users who purchase the same product from their posts or in other words there are users who click the â€œbasketâ€ button through their posts, then the post owner will receive a kickback. While users who buy will receive cashback. Very interesting right? Provisions for how much cashback and kickback the user will get depend on the percentage determined by each producer.Besides purchasing through this post, Sessia users can also get cashback and kickback if they invite new users to join Sessiaâ€™s social media. The concept remains the same, where they will get cashback and kickback when a purchase transaction is made. But the benefits will be greater. If a user, say A, invites B to join Sessia, B will be registered and obtain an account as we create an account on other social media. A and B can see the posts that appear on the homepage. If A posts a purchase transaction and then B also buys the product by posting A, then A will receive a kickback and B will receive cashback.When B invites other new users, say C, then C will be registered and have an account also in Sessia. The next procedure will be the same, B and C can see their posts. The difference is that if B posts the purchase transaction and C makes a purchase through posting B, then C will receive cashback. Whereas A and B will receive a kickback. Even though A is not directly related to C, A will still be able to receive profits. This concept applies to 4th generation users or new users invited by C. If C invites new users, say D, the same procedure also applies to both. D will be registered and have an account and can view posts C and vice versa. When C posts a purchase transaction then D buys the same product through posting C, then D will get cashback. While A, B, and C will get a kickback. This concept is very beneficial for Sessia users and only this platform provides benefits like this. Users can use their KICKS digital tokens for various types of transactions easily and practically.For more information please click the link below:Website: https://sessia.com/index.htmlWhitepaper: https://sessia.com/stasic/doc/wp_eng-2018.compressed.pdf----ico lite--ico lite--ico lite--ico lite--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Jon CrabbinCoinmonks--22PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

450,8641,https://medium.com/@LitecoinDotCom/blockstream-launches-musig-a-proposed-new-multi-signature-standard-d594f796ebf?source=tag_archive---------100-----------------------,"Blockstream Launches MuSig, A Proposed New Multi-Signature Standard.",None,Litecoin.Com,https://medium.com/,2,11,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*BJFmNLWGrTGISwnB1xfKEQ.jpeg","Litecoin.ComFollow--ListenShareBlockstreamâ€™s new MuSig proposal, based on Schnorr signatures, that was originally drafted over a year ago on 15th January 2018, has just been released. The scheme if accepted would replace the existing ECDSA signatures and claims to be more efficient and offer:â€œProvable security, even against colluding subsets of malicious signers, and produces signatures indistinguishable from ordinary single-signer Schnorr signatures.â€The change would make signatures used within multi-sig transactions much more consistently sized and shorter saving time on validation and space within each block. It would also introduce greater flexibility into the system something not currently allowed with ECDSA.â€œECDSA signatures have a complex algebraic structure that makes them inflexible and difficult to work with, forcing developers to use Bitcoin Script for applications such as cross-chain atomic swaps or Lightning, which could be implemented more compactly and privately using a more flexible signature scheme.â€The new code has been merged into secp256k1-zkp, a fork of secp256k1, the high-assurance cryptographic library used by Bitcoin Core, making it available for other developers outside of blockstream to test and scrutinise. The team hope the change will eventually be approved and merged upstream making it publicly available and active on the network however they are aware of issues that would most definitely need addressing first. Since diving into the realm of digital signatures for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, they report discovering that many other similar schemes, including an early version of their own MuSig was insecure.â€œFurther, since announcing MuSig, we have learned that many published signature schemes, including an earlier unpublished version of MuSig, are actually insecure! We will explore this further in a future post.â€There are also concerns around replay attacks of these new signatures, where an attacker might be able to extract the individuals secret key, something Blockstream are upfront with:â€œTo protect signers who may serialize stale states and restart from them, our API simply does not support serialization of signing sessions. What this means in practice is that users of our code who want to support signing sessions that can survive across power resets or interruptions â€” which is a reasonable goal for a hardware wallet â€” must maintain secure persistent memory.â€This isnâ€™t the only area the team are aware that needs improving and they plan on writing further papers on how to improve the MuSig proposal. Topics of discussion will include extending support to threshold signatures, how to make the nonce randomness safer and more verifiable by using a technique called sign-to-contract, along with leveraging zero knowledge proofs to mitigate the threats of replay attacks.----Money for the internet age â— Bringing you everything LitecoinLitecoin.Com--1Litecoin.Com--Litecoin.Com--1Litecoin.Com--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

I have the team at The Futur to thank for their collaboration and guidance. Ben Burns and Chris Do have helped guide this and mold it to be the best it can be for our community.The new kit is an update to the original CORE Strategy kit released several years ago. It adds new exercises and a Brief Template. But the most important part is the conceptual framework that allows for you to masterfully translate Strategy into Design.These are the 8 parts that make up the core of the new kit.The CORE Manifesto sheds some light on the foundation for the framework. In most companies Designers donâ€™t have strategic roles. The strategists are for the most part from other disciplines. That is changing but for now letâ€™s assume that is the norm. Therefore the first bullet in the manifesto starts the new narrative. â€œThe Designer as Strategic Leader.â€Now that you stepped into the role of â€œStrategic Leaderâ€ (If you can make that jump.) youâ€™ll have to facilitate the collaboration. Vs. just being the scope patrol and delivering exactly what was in the brief. The second bullet point in the manifesto opens up a new portal in the relationship with a client. Where you are co-creating, listening to each other, flowing together and producing impactful work. Innovation comes from collaboration.So you see. CORE Discovery is what creates that relationship on teams. And the fact that is lead by Designers takes things to a new level. As if we drive both the strategy and the design of solving problems for people and the planet we become stewards for change. We go from fancy stylist to future world builders. Are you getting what I am dropping here?Ok, and now what you have been waiting for. Here are the 8 exercises for CORE Discovery broken down into; â€œWhat need does it solve? What is the goal of it? And what are the outcomes?Need: People love it when they are included. In a meeting, in a plan, on a team. This exercise uses the same process as the Brand Attributes Exercise to understand the top 3 things each person wants to get out of the work session.Goal: The goal is simple, to understand the outcomes that people want out of your time together. And to acknowledge that we heard them. Common things that people express is that they â€œwant to get clarityâ€ from the process. Another common interest is that they want the team to be â€œon the same page.â€Outcomes: The outcome is that each person was heard. At the the end of the exercise we prioritize â€œonly one thingâ€ that if they got from the session would make them happy â€” I repeat the top 6â€“7 (Depending on team size) that the team said and I ensure that I deliver that to them by the end of the session. If I didnâ€™t deliver it I tell them that I will try on the next session or offline after the session.Need: The first and most important container that drives strategy is an understanding of who we are. The company, the startup, the non-profit or the mom and pop upstart. They all want to know who they are. Call it a Mission Statement or Brand Statement. What they do, for who they do it, how they do it, how it feels and how it impacts the world is the foundation of any journey.Goal: The goal of this exercise is to work together to come up with a Brand Statement. This statement gives you the key attributes that will help guide you in the Design process that will follow. The goal is alignment and clarity of vision.Outcomes: To quote the CMO of a 100 million dollar manufacturing company in Southern California; â€œWe just paid $300,000 to do our Mission Statement. You just did a better job with our team in 60 min.â€ Of course I said â€” â€œDamn, you are not paying us enough.â€ But my point is that when you include the entire team in the creation of a concise brand statement â€” not only are they now invested in their own vision but the work is much higher in fidelity that if you went away and did it on your own. At the end you will have a brand statement that serves as the blueprint to create the right solution.Need: You donâ€™t need to be a marketing or UX genius to know that the foundation for delivering value with any product or service is to understand customer needs. But you will be surprised how many companies or organizations are not clear on who their customers are. They know their product and they might even have customer data but seldom is the entire team clear, aligned and prioritized around customer needs.Goal: The goal of this exercise is to define 3â€“4 customer profiles and prioritize their needs and goals. Using the customer knowledge of those in the room and also including actual data from the companies own research.Outcomes: The customer profiles you deliver have something that is invaluable for an organization. Agreement. Your job as a facilitator is to confirm that the profiles and priorities you came up with together are good enough to move forward to create the product, service design, brand identity, promotional video, app design or whatever you are creating for yourself or your customer. At the end of this exercise you will have 3 profiles with 3 top needs and solutions for each.PS. Failure to do this on any project will create chaos, mis-alignment, wasted effort and overall lack of results.Need: People need to know what they need to do next. What to focus on. Where to expend their effort. More so, people (I personally hate this) hate to waste their time doing something that is going to get changed or thrown away later. We all want to know what the priorities are.Goal: More important than just wasting time is actually being effective. Continuously being ineffective is what gets executives, designers and agencies fired. So the goal of this exercise is to define the Revenue (Monetization), Awareness (Marketing) and Efficiency (Operational) priorities. You donâ€™t have to have an MBA to do these. All you need is to ask the right questions. And listen. Read the room to get the truth about what people are really thinking is important.Outcomes: Laser sharp focus. That is one of the outcomes. You will have a top 3 priorities in each category. More so you will have a list of â€œTo-doâ€™sâ€ for the entire team. All â€œStack Rankedâ€ in a systemized way by the people who are going to be executing it. This takes organizations many meetings and much in-fighting to get to this. In CORE this happens in one session.Need: So after you are done with defining the Brand Attributes what do you do with them? That is a question Iâ€™ve gotten over and over. How do you translate them? Great question. What Iâ€™ve always done is select a few of them for each of the design directions I am planning on presenting. Over the last year I experimented on how to select these. Because at the end you canâ€™t design to every single attribute.Goal: The goal of this exercise is to make the further refinement and translation of Attributes into tangible design â€” clearer and systematic. To select 1 main attributes and 3 supporting attributes. The overarching system used in this exercise is story structure. How a character shows up in the story, how they make people feel and what impact they have on them.Outcomes: At the end of this exercise you will have 3 setâ€™s of Attributes mapped to a system that allows you to design any experience. And I donâ€™t mean apps or software. I mean experiences from the beginning to the end. And then repeat. It gives you a framework for delivering value in a dynamic and living way. Not just to create static art or static experiences. A living brand.Need: What are the solutions that come out of the CORE framework? Meaning aside from what the client requested (A website, a video, an identity, etc) what would solve their business problems? This is sometimes tricky. Designers donâ€™t feel knowledgable enough or powerful enough to pull out solutions from their own set of experiences.Goal: The goal of this exercise is to take the top 3 needs of a Customer and match them with the priorities of the business. This is the what I call â€œThe Weave.â€ In weaving together the narrative of what the business needs to grow with the needs of the customer and brainstorming solutions that are a â€œWin, Winâ€ for both you get what I call â€œHigh Fidelity.â€ Where the solutions you design match both the customer and the business so well that your client thinks you are a genius.Outcomes: The outcome is a series of solutions that push the boundaries of creativity. That proverbial â€œboxâ€ that so many companies look to break out from. This is ultimately a space that produces a lot of solution ideas. But because the options are generated in the intersection of customer needs and company goals the solutions are far more plausible as effective options.PS. The next exercise allows you to put some of these ideas into action.Need: How do you put the solutions you brainstormed into action? The answer is that you have to put them into the context of time. In user experience we use â€œCustomer Journeysâ€ to accomplish this. The narrative of these journeys is what creates impact. If you are able to take a user through this adventure the outcome should be happy customers.Goal: The goal of this exercise is to map these journeys for 3â€“4 of your customers parallel vertically vs. horizontally. The purpose for this is so that you can see the interconnections between each of the solutions in each customer journey. To see how these customers are inter-related or at a minimum how you can leverage your own customers to provide additional value to them by having them interact in community.Outcomes: You will have a clear narrative of the experience you are creating. You will also have a view of it that allows for you to see how your customers can interact and overlap. This starts the creation of culture and community. It gives you a â€œview from above.â€ It gives you clarity and a roadmap.Need: To make the jump from doing it all. Doing it alone. From solo freelancer to the facilitator of opportunities for your clients â€” you have to brief others as to the design directions to take. This is where you become a director. A director needs a brief. A playbook. Instructions to give those who are helping you. Whether they were in the sessions or not.Goal: The goal of the brief is to inform the 2-3 design directions that you are going to be putting together for the client. Itâ€™s also the place that you get to â€œplan the design.â€ The conceptual framework that you use to guide you comes forward here. I am going to share the conceptual framework I use to translate. A conceptual framework is akin to a philosophy. There are 5 questions that I ask in this framework. Starting with â€œWhat is the highest impact, lowest effort solution that I have to create to move the business goals of this company or idea?â€ I also use the question; â€œWhat is the single most energized motif that that came up during our CORE sessions and conversations with the team?â€Outcomes: The brief provides 3 distinct design directions based on a selection of attributes, ideas gleaned from data matching and the impact narrative. It serves as a place to synthesize youâ€™re thinking and direct the momentum of the project. Itâ€™s a powerful tool. Itâ€™s the agreement that is formed after the CORE sessions. You get the brief signed by the client. Itâ€™s the gate to the next phase. Design. Starting with Stylescapes.Thank you for looking at this update. I hope you enjoyed it.

Example:-Strings:- Any collection of characters viz words or sentences are represented using strings in almost all of the programming languages.The list of methods that can be used to manipulate lists are as follows:-The first thing to keep in mind is that indexes start from 0 in python therefore when we print â€œuser[1]â€ in the second line we actually get â€œoâ€ which is the second character in the string. We have used â€œ:â€ operator in the third line to specify the range of characters which we want to extract from a string. So when we specify the range from 1 to 3 above, we actually starting from the second character i.e. index 1 till index 3 i.e. 4th character.Lists: Lists are used to represent a collection of similar items just like arrays in JavaScript or Java.Some of the methods of python lists are:-Keep in mind that if we use a negative value as an index then python will start counting items from the end of the list. For example, using â€œ-1â€ as the index will print the last value from the given list.In order to get specific items from the above list we can make use of â€œ:â€ operator similar what we did in the case of a list.Tuples:Tuples are other data types similar to lists. They differ from lists in the following ways:Let cover some basic tuples operations:-Arithmetic Operations:-Letâ€™s cover basic arithmetic operations in the snippet below:Logical Operators:There are 3 main logical operators in python:-Well, that finishes of todayâ€™s basic tutorial. In the next one, we will try to cover conditional loops and how to define functions in python language.You can follow us on Facebook or Twitter for getting updates on the next programming tutorial.

I responded to her as I was typing an email at my computer without skipping a beat or giving it much thought, â€œSunny later today, high around 63. Itâ€™s going to start raining again tomorrow afternoon.â€ The exchange made me pause and reflect. I thought, â€œWow, I sound like some kind of human Amazon Echo!â€I am often in tune with the current weather and the forecast for days ahead. My wife knows this about me, which is why she asks me about the forecast when she is figuring out her outfit for the workday. I suppose asking me about the dayâ€™s forecast is more personalized and entertaining than checking her own weather app. But how do I possess this trivial knowledge even though I donâ€™t seem to put much effort or attention into acquiring it?Upon closer scrutiny of my online behavior, however, I realize that I often check the local weather report multiple times per day. I donâ€™t spend long periods of time on my weather app, but I do check it often. This has been my routine for so long that I donâ€™t really think about it, much like someone might habitually and mindlessly check their Twitter feed throughout the day. I am often in and out of my weather app in less than ten or fifteen seconds.I enjoy glancing over multi-day weather forecasts which employ sexy visualizations that display the correlation between different elements of the weather as they change over time, for example how humidity goes down and air pressure goes up as a cool front moves through.But this got me thinking: how much of my awareness of the weather is gleaned from weather apps versus direct observation and experience? Which begs a larger question: In an age when we are so electronically engrossed in our digital lives and tethered to our electronic devices, how do we remain in touch with our natural surroundings?I realized there are two themes at work here. First, the weather can be thought of as one big continuous story, and some of us are interested in following its narrative â€” whether by the season, the week, the day, or even hourly. There is no beginning or end, but the continuous plot is captivating. Second, the best technology is that which aids you in the real analog world somehow without superseding it or making you dependent on the technology in order to live your life or experience your environment. For me, following the story of weather is something I am naturally drawn to and the technology simply makes it more fun and engaging.I have always been fascinated by the weatherâ€”not just dramatic events like thunderstorms, blizzards, tornadoes, droughts, or hurricanesâ€”but also the typical uneventful weather that might go unnoticed on any given day because it is not calling much attention to itself. I consciously and subconsciously take note of conditions when I am outside: what kind of clouds are in the sky and which direction or how fast they are moving, how humid it is and what the air smells like, how strong the wind is blowing and from what direction, and any unusual activity by wildlife. On a given afternoon walk, for example, I might consciously register that the diffuse silvery light I see is caused by high-altitude cirrus clouds, which often indicate a pending change in the weather such as an approaching cool front.When I was a kid growing up in the 1970s and 80s swampy forests of East Texas, one of my favorite parts of the day was watching the weather forecast during the local six oâ€™clock evening news. Yes, friends, the geekery runs deep with this one. We lived remote enough that â€˜localâ€™ meant going outside of my grandmotherâ€™s mobile home trailer and physically turning the television antennae to point toward the big city of Houston, about 60 miles to the south, in order to pick up the closest TV station. Or twisting the antennae 45 degrees counter-clockwise to pick up the TV signal out of the city of Beaumont to the southeast. Because of how the television signals were broadcast, you had to align the antennae with the source to get a clearer picture. I say â€œclearerâ€ because we lived far enough away from the stations that the TV picture always contained some level of static or noise, so you got it as close to clear as you could. Kids these days have no idea â€” the struggle was real.I loved those daily evening weather segments. An amiable weather forecaster named Doug Johnson would deliver the weather report, complete with sequences of the weather forecast hand-drawn in black and red markers upon a large notepad which sat on an easel. He would flip over a page for each day of the week like a giant storybook or flipbook, illustrating the progression of cold fronts, rain, and the like during the coming days. With a great sense of humor, a beaming smile, and bright eyes, he would deliver the weather report with charisma and character. All of this illustrated the narrative and performative quality of weather for me at an early age. He was telling a story, and he happened to be a good storyteller.Fast forward to now, and weather reporting has achieved the heights of big-budget spectacle. The dramatic story-telling quality of weather is capitalized upon by mainstream media such as The Weather Channel with its comprehensive branding and action movie-like presentation style, complete with reporters who broadcast live while standing unnecessarily in hurricane-force winds for cinematic effect. Weather reporting has become a highly produced, polished and dramatic cable news spectacle which includes sophisticated digital graphics and even augmented reality. It is now common to survey the aftermath of floods, storms, and forest fires via drone videos, and high-resolution satellite imagery can illustrate large-scale damage, such as the before-and-after images of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria devasted the island.As a teenager, I was obsessed with airplanes and learning how to fly, and a part of my love of flying had a lot to do with my fascination with the weather. A seminal text for every budding pilot was Robert Buckâ€™s Weather Flying. One of the things I remember about the book was the authorâ€™s suggestion for aspiring pilots to learn how to read the weather, or more specifically, to learn how to read the clouds. You can glean a lot of information about flying conditions just from observing simple phenomena like cloud types and size, wind direction, and knowing how different terrain produces different rates of heating or cooling in the air above it. You have likely experienced this latter phenomenon while on a commercial flight: On a hot summer day at lower altitudes, the plane is likely to â€˜bounceâ€™ upward as it encounters rapidly rising hot air over cemented areas, desert, or plowed farmland, and then â€˜dropâ€™ dramatically as the plane encounters cooler, sinking air over ponds, rivers, and lakes. The changes between these two air temperature extremes can sometimes be abrupt, causing the plane to instantly drop or rise as a result. In addition to all of the technical knowledge which pilots must remember, the author encouraged the use of a sort of sixth sense about the weather. His point was that being aware of your environment and surroundings is just as important as learning all the technical jargon and procedures.These references to the reading of and telling stories about the weather suggest that the weather has a narrative quality about it. This characteristic manifests itself within popular culture in different ways. Most of us have seen the wind depicted in old maps or architectural detailing as blowing human faces. (By the way, I discovered that people collect this kind of imagery online using categories such as â€œblowing wind face.â€) Calendars and almanacs are graphical and textual narratives about the seasons, the latter full of details for farmers on what to expect for the coming yearâ€™s climate conditions and how it will affect their crops. A whole generation of British citizens has been lulled to sleep each night by the dreamy broadcasts of BBCâ€™s famous Shipping Forecasts. Hurricanes and winter storms are given names just like the characters in a play. The website for the Old Farmerâ€™s Almanac maintains a list of â€œweather proverbs and folklore about rainâ€ which includes gems such as:There are many cultural artifacts such as these that reinforce the concept of weather as narrative and as something that can be read or depicted artistically with human characteristics.Now I think of the weather app on my Mac or on my phone. Checking in on the weather report multiple times per day is like keeping my finger on the pulse of a perpetually unfolding story. Over time I recognize the plot twists, the characters, and how the story ebbs and flows. Maybe today things are going to be calm and uneventful. But this evening I notice some story elements building tension toward what I know is going to be some kind of dramatic episode in the morning. â€œLooks like the shitâ€™s going to hit the fan around 3 a.m.,â€ I remember telling my wife recently. Sometimes I am surprised by unexpected plot twists, tragedy, or even humor.As I mentioned in the introduction, the best technology will supplement our knowledge and activities and benefit us out in the real world. On a stormy spring afternoon early last year, my cell phone blew up with an emergency tornado warning telling me to take shelter immediately. For those readers who do not know, the American National Weather Service designates a â€œtornado watchâ€ to mean that weather conditions are favorable for a tornado, and a â€œtornado warningâ€ means a confirmed tornado is on the ground. Luckily my wife was home, and she and I gathered up our three-legged cattle dog and our two older cats and headed down into the basement (weâ€™re lucky to have a basement!). We stayed put until the all-clear showed up on my phone. We were spared the worst, but the east side of our city of Greensboro, North Carolina was hit by the tornado. This is a great example of how, when used properly and in moderation, technology not only potentially enhances our lives but could ultimately save them.Much like the annually repeating story of nature â€” such as the thrill of seeing the robins who return to build their nest on our front porch every spring or the joy of watching the maple tree leaves turn colors in the fallâ€”the never-ending story and rhythm of weather and seasons is engrained in our biological and cultural psyche. Weather, like nature, unites us all as a backdrop of life regardless of location, sex, age, race, nationality, or socio-economic status. As of late, climate change is bringing our close relationship to weather into sharp relief.Every location on earth has its own unique local climate patterns and weather phenomena. Learning to understand and read those conditions comes with increased awareness of and connection to a place. Being in tune with your local weather through direct observation and experience means you are fully engaged with and aware of your lived environment. Supplementing this knowledge with technology can be a rich and beneficial experience.Me: â€œHey Siri! Itâ€™s my turn to walk the dog in the morning. What time will it be daylight?â€Siri: â€œIâ€™m sorry, I didnâ€™t understand.â€Well, most of the time.----2Writer. Wanderer. Lover of animals, nature, big skies, and stars.

But before comparing the two technologies, we need to understand the logic behind DAGs.The Directed Acyclic Graph is a data structure in computer science. A graph in this context represents a network of interconnected nodes. The information passes through DAG acyclically, as said in the name. This means that a transaction in a DAG-based system doesnâ€™t go through the graph in cycles. Instead, when the information is transmitted from a node, there is no way this information will return to the sender without passing through other nodes that have already received the information earlier. Similar to the blockchain, it is impossible to start at one point and traverse the entire network.The flow of information has a direction â€” like a one-way street for information. Blockchain, again, similarly, uses the same logic. There is no way to return to the node without passing through other nodes first. Each block refers to the previous one, creating a direction in the blockchain.The core difference between the two technologies is that DAG allows multiple chains of blocks to exist, while blockchain supports only one main chain. This is possible with DAG since the nodes can operate in parallel, as long as the flow of information remains directed.Another big thing brought by the DAG structure is that block timestamps are no longer required, allowing transactions to occur almost instantaneously. Also, the mining problems such as the one where two miners find a block at exactly the same time and create multiple chains, needing a consensus to be reached on which blockchain to use and which to abandon do not exist with DAG protocols.DAG networks offer a far better scalability potential than the blockchains do, which is a critical step on the road to mass adoption. It is far more energy-efficient than Proof of Work used in Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, while still providing full decentralization and high levels of security.

The period between steam engines supplying coal to parts of the United States to the age of quantum computing has been showered with astounding ingenious innovations. The era has greatly benefited mankind in almost every aspect of their day-to-day lives.Imagine what lives people might have been accustomed to just 400 years ago. Diseases were the norm for an average citizen throughout their lives and journeys to other nations would take weeks. Much of those diseases rarely cause an outbreak today and vaccine attempts to prevent most of those diseases from surfacing on the populace. Traveling from Los Angeles to Barcelona takes less than a day today by a flight. Thereâ€™s the curiosity to check out the grandest celestial bodies and also a peek into the inner mechanisms of an atom.It certainly is a great time to be alive! Witnessing such extraordinary events that are paving humanity to be more advanced in technology.With this in mind, letâ€™s glance over some of the top trending technologies that are dominating this year.With the potential of a large number of jobs, Big Data is one of the most impressive and imperative trends of this age. The field is dedicated to analyze, extract information, and deal with immensely large data sets which becomes a herculean task if done manually. Big data can be used in the case of structured and unstructured data. With structured data, it becomes easy to analyze and organize into the database. Unstructured data is much harder to analyze as well as it uses a vast array of formats.* Volume- Itâ€™s the size of the data that determines if it can be considered as big data or not. * Velocity- It is the speed at which the data is generated and processed. * Variety- The type and nature of the data. * Veracity â€” It refers to the data quality and data value, being an extended definition of big data.* Big data tools like Hadoop can be cost efficient when large amounts of data can be stored. * Tools like Hadoop and in-memory analytics notices new sources of data and helps businesses analyze the data to make quick decisions. * Knowing customer demands, users will have an edge to deliver what they want. * It is a really great tool for sentiment analyses which is vital to keep up the brand value.Hurrying home to prepare that turkey for Thanksgiving tomorrow? With IoT (Internet of Things), you can preheat the oven from your remote. You can do that at the same time while booking an Uber and uploading your weekend pictures on Instagram.IoT enables many devices to be connected to the internet and with each other to provide an exchange of data. They can be your oven, the lock of your doors, personal vehicles and even your toaster. IoT devices numbered 8.4 billion in 2017. It is predicted to go as high as 31 billion devices by 2020.Businesses will be gaining a lot from this concept as well. Enabling efficiency, safety as well as decision making for businesses as data is collected and is analyzed. Bettering the lives of patients, predicting future sales growth, polishing customer services, and increase revenue are just some of the possible outcomes from a greater dependency on IoT.The main hindrance to IoT is the lack of trained IT professionals. According to IT Pro Today, not many IT experts are trying to get the skills needed to be trained in IoT. For those interested in IoT, entry into this field might be very smooth as they will be highly motivated by themselves and choose resources on their own to plant those skills in them.Angular is one of the most famed software development tools. Developed by Google and launched in 2009, it was initially dubbed as Angular.js, but it had many issues at the time. In 2016, it was rewritten, and it took the name, Angular.There are many benefits of using Angular for your project. Here are a few of them:* Angular makes testing fairly easy. The built-in-testing functionality and works with karma and Jasmine frameworks. It is easy to test components since dependency injection is integrated into the structure. * The framework grows because if the hard work and support of the community. There will always be someone there to help you out if you are stuck. * Angular is supported by a majority of the IDEs. * Being a star-child of Google, it makes sense that it gives an astonishing performance.R is a programming language used for analysis, statistics and machine learning. R can create packages, objects, and functions. R can be installed free of charge and without any license.R is an excellent choice for data science because: * One can run their code without the help of any compiler. * R is used in biology, statistics and also in genetics. * R is powerful and faster compared to any other programming language.These are web applications that lead to regular websites and web pages. Along with that, they offer some unique functionality such as push notifications, working offline and device hardware access that was only possible for a native application.* Progressive Web Apps or PWIs use a minuscule amount of data compared to native applications. * Manual updates are not required. * These are cheaper to produce but still packs the same punch of efficiency. * So far, PWAs have delivered great business results.A growing list of records called blocks, linked with cryptography is called Blockchain. Every block has a cryptographic hash of the last block, general data, and timestamp. Simply put, its the digital information (represented by blocks) stored in a public database (represented by chains).* Blockchain being a distributed ledger, all network participants share the same document. * After every transaction is completed, it is linked with the previous transaction. * Transactions are done quickly and with efficiency * With the lack of third parties, the transactions with Blockchain becomes easier.Used by major companies such as Google, Yahoo, YouTube and NASA, Python has a reputation for being simpler compared to its competitors like C# and JavaScript. Itâ€™s one of the most popular programming languages across the globe and its gaining speed in that. Python is also believed to beat JavaScript as the most popular programming language in the future.* It is praised by developers for its efficiency and speed. * Fast runtime data structures can be created quickly thanks to its built-in list and dictionary data structures. * Learning ease and uncluttered easy-to-understand syntax which is great news for beginners. * A huge community is always there to help you out of a problem while making your project. * Being open source, it is cost effective * It is capable of interacting with other platforms and languages.DevOps is a term used to define a set of concepts that have been made into a rapidly spreading movement throughout the technical community. Many even claim that it exists due to the amalgamation of two words; development and operations. It helps to maximize the speed of an institution and deliver services and applications.Simply put, it is the alignment of development and IT operations with better communication.A few technical benefits of DevOps: * Fewer complexities to handle. * Perpetual delivery of softwares. * Problems are solved quickly.A few business benefits of DevOps: * Faster delivery of features and more productive teams. * Collaboration and Communication are improved. * More time to innovate than just sit and keep fixing the same old problems.Some of the best resources for Learning DevOps: * Scripting Essentials for DevOps (4.7 Stars, 4 Sections, 4 Hours) * Learn To Build DevOps Pipeline On Azure Cloud (4.4 Stars, 8 Sections, 6.5 Hours) * Project in DevOps â€” Learn Real World DevOps (4.4 Stars, 8 Sections, 9 Hours)Originally published at https://blog.eduonix.com on April 17, 2019.----It is an Online Learning Patform for students of all ages who wants to learn web programming courses onlineEduonix Learning Solution--Eduonix Learning Solution--Eduonix Learning Solution--Eduonix Learning Solution--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Alex Mathers--220Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Will Youtube keep up?I wrote a short thread on Twitter about the challenges facing Youtube & itâ€™s evolution. Would love your comments.In India however Youtube has nothing to worry about, regional video is showing strong growth. Creators are too young to be fatigued.Newer categories of videos have emerged like Village Cooking, Henna tattoo design for brides, spiritual gurus & Indian engineering school cram courses.The diversity of content on Youtube continues to grow. A recent article says that for Indians Youtube is the new Google. From our conversations with creators, we find that Youtube is the top-choice platform for serious creators â€” people whoâ€™ve found fame on Instagram, Tik-tok or Snapchat, they all want a Youtube channel. Thus the growth of newer short video platforms is creating new stars who can make Youtube a home. However there are some challenges.One area of concern for Youtube is itâ€™s slow adoption of live streaming. Creators increasingly are searching for ways to regularly communicate with their audience & sustainable ways to grow it besides creating content. Youtube launched live streaming for mobile devices only in Feb 2017 supporting creators with more than 10k subscribers but hasnâ€™t promoted it to a great extent. Instagram on the other hand has been quick to innovate letting you go live with a friend(user) creating new use-cases for engagement(Yes, the two platforms are different so the feature makes more sense on Insta but platforms need to become a 2-way street rather than 1 way).Youtube recently launched Stories in an effort to let creators engage with itâ€™s audience more frequently than by just posting videos.Discord has become the prime candidate for creators wanting to build community & own the channel of communication beyond the primary platform â€” Youtube in this case. In Carryâ€™s case, heâ€™s supplemented creating videos with gaming.In conclusion, will newer players out-innovate Youtube? Will Tik-tok be the new Youtube as some people predict? Whichever way it goes in the long term, the platform that helps you monetize in addition to growing your following will win. For now that platform is still Youtube.Do add your comments & tell me what you think.Appendix:----Product ManagerDinesh--5DineshinGrowth Bugâ€Šâ€”â€ŠTechnology | Product | Growth | Apps--3Dinesh--11DineshinGrowth Bugâ€Šâ€”â€ŠTechnology | Product | Growth | Apps--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Kristen WaltersinAdventures In AI--121Scott H.

GTC 2019 runs next Monday through Thursday (March 18â€“21), and while we can only speculate what surprises NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang might have in store for us, we can get some sense of where the company is headed by looking at what itâ€™s been up to for the last 12 months.NVIDIA is steadily expanding its foothold in artificial intelligence and in 2018 contributed numerous noteworthy research results to the machine learning community, including StyleGAN, video-to-video translation, WaveGlow, and more.The companyâ€™s AI-related efforts make sense, as NVIDIA is a major supplier of graphics cards to AI researchers and developers. Because GPUs remain the dominant option for training machine learning models, NVIDIA sales will obviously benefit from AI development and deployment. NVIDIA also leverages the knowledge obtained from AI experiments to help further evolve and polish its chip designs. The companyâ€™s latest GPU architectures â€” Turing and RTX â€” are good instances of this, as they feature Tensor Cores designed to accelerate the large matrix operations which are the heart of AI.NVIDIA is also infusing AI capabilities into its chips as an additional selling point, and recently launched its DLSS (deep learning supersampling) technology on the video game Battlefield V, available with RTX GPU. This is essentially a deep learning technique which enables higher resolutions and settings while maintaining solid frame rates.Below is Syncedâ€™s overview of NVIDIAâ€™s main AI-related research and products since the last GTC.NVIDIA researchers took a big step towards photorealistic image generation by introducing StyleGAN (A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks). The research team proposed a novel generator architecture for GAN that draws insights from style transfer techniques. The system can learn and separate different aspects of an image unsupervised; and enable intuitive, scale-specific control of the synthesis.While previous GANs could not control what specific features they wanted to regenerate, the new generator can adjust the effect of a particular style â€” for example high-level facial attributes such as pose, identity, shape â€” without changing any other features. This enables better control of specific features such as eyes and hairstyles.Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948GitHub: https://github.com/NVlabs/styleganWaveGlow is NVIDIAâ€™s latest innovation tackling the task of end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis. In the paper WaveGlow: A Flow-based Generative Network for Speech Synthesis, NVIDIA researchers proved the auto-regressive approach is unnecessary for synthesizing speech. Instead, they combined ideas from Glow and WaveNet, and proposed a network capable of generating high quality speech from mel-spectrograms, a feature that represents the short-term power spectrum of a sound.WaveGlow is implemented using only a single network and trained with a single cost function. While most models struggle to synthesize audio faster than 16kHZ without sacrificing audio quality, WaveGlow can generate speech at more than 500kHz â€” and more than 25 times faster than real time â€” while delivering audio quality comparable with the best publicly available WaveNet implementations.Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00002.pdfGitHub: https://github.com/NVIDIA/waveglowVideo synthesis technology has a wide range of applications in gaming, automotive, virtual reality, and more. Traditional graphic rendering engines however require cumbersome and time-consuming detailing involving scene geometry, materials, lighting, and dynamics. Many researchers are now investing in end-to-end deep learning models.In the paper Video-to-Video Synthesis, NVIDIA researchers introduced a GAN-based model to synthesize high-quality videos. The proposed approach can generate photorealistic 2K resolution videos up to 30 seconds long, which significantly advances the state-of-the-art of video synthesis. The paper was accepted by NeurIPS 2018.Following on that success, NVIDIA researchers trained the model on video of cities to render an interactive 3D urban environment. While this is still a proof-of-concept, it is believed the technique can push development in multiple areas, for example in autonomous driving where it can providing a simplified approach for simulating road conditions.Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06601.pdfGitHub: https://github.com/NVIDIA/vid2vidSlow motion is common in todayâ€™s television and filmmaking industry, used to detail short-term perspectives in sports broadcasts and home videos, or to create artistic effects in movies, etc. In the paper Super SloMo: High Quality Estimation of Multiple Intermediate Frames for Video Interpolation, NVIDIA proposed an end-to-end convolutional neural network which can produce high-quality slow-motion videos from a standard 30-frame-per-second video.The goal of the slow motion task is essentially to generate multiple intermediate video frames. NVIDIAâ€™s method can interpolate a frame at any arbitrary time step between two frames. The experiment results show the new approach outperforming other state-of-the-art models. The paper was accepted by CVPR 2018.Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00080.pdfPoor image quality is an enemy of many visual editing and presentation tasks. In the paper Noise2Noise: Learning Image Restoration without Clean Data, NVIDIA researchers introduced a deep learning approach which can easily remove image noise and artifacts.While image editing processes have existed for years, previous image restoration techniques required training data including both noisy and clean images. NVIDIA proved that the collection of clean images is unnecessary for denoising, which exempted researcher from the time-consuming practices of data collection and preprocessing. The paper was accepted by ICML 2018.Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04189.pdfGitHub: https://github.com/NVlabs/noise2noiseImage inpainting is an image restoration task that basically fills blank holes in an image. A number of photo editing softwares for example use this technique when removing unwanted content, to fill the resulting â€œholesâ€ with contiguous and realistic computer-generated content. The challenge becomes more difficult if the holes are irregularly shaped.In the paper Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions, NVIDIA researchers proposed a model to edit images with irregular hole patterns and produce generated content that seamlessly incorporates with the rest of the image. The paper was accepted by ICLR 2018.Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07723.pdfSynced will be reporting from GTC 2019 throughout the week.Journalist: Tony Peng | Editor: Michael Sarazen2018 Fortune Global 500 Public Company AI Adaptivity Report is out!Purchase a Kindle-formatted report on Amazon.

That the comment was followed by a next-day walk-back has done little to quell the media backlash nor stifle the call among Twitter activists that Uber customers mass-delete the app.Failure of such magnitude isnâ€™t an accident. It takes practice â€” over the course of days, months, often years. Uber was founded in 2009. It has a decade-long track record of saying the exact wrong thing. Each new failing stacks on top of the previous, creating a true monument to PR ineptitude.Among Uberâ€™s most successful failures: Former CEO Travis Kalanickâ€™s GQ profile, where he describes his increased appeal to women as a â€œBoob-erâ€ and deflects a question about customer service issues by channeling Charlie Sheen: â€œIf you can get a Prius for cheaper than a taxi, you just changed 100,000 peopleâ€™s lives in a city. If you can get it reliably? Holy shitâ€¦Thatâ€™s hashtag winning.â€Being sexist, quoting a sexist celebrity with the social profile of expired milk â€” are only part of the formula.Also key is timing. If you want a PR disaster thatâ€™s in the same league as Uberâ€™s, you must say the exact wrong thing, at the exact wrong moment. For instance, when you are in the middle of a labor dispute with your drivers, thatâ€™s the perfect instant for one of your co-founders to get caught buying a $72.5 million mansion in Beverly Hills.The principle at work here is optics. Itâ€™s about not caring how something you do looks. In Goodfellas, when the members of Jimmyâ€™s gang show up at the Christmas party with the fur coats and brand-new Cadillacs they bought with that Lufthansa heist money, they are demonstrating that, like an unruly gang of techbros, a true PR disaster must court the direst consequences.For Uber, itâ€™s not the cops who are the problem. Itâ€™s the companyâ€™s lagging profitability, its unsuccessful attempts to diversify beyond its core ride-hailing business and its indifference to public sentiment. According to a recent Pew Research survey, people rate the technology industry somewhere between airlines and getting barfed on on the NYC subway. For those of you who havenâ€™t been paying attention, hereâ€™s a quick recap: Steve Jobs is dead, dead, dead. Nobody is hanging on Tim Cookâ€™s launch keynotes, and there are no lines winding around the block for the new iPhone.What should you do? How should your company kick-start its journey toward PR disaster?We are living on the age of the 3 a.m. tweet, when the long-term benefits of strategic communications are secondary to the immediate dopamine rush of the spectacle.

Bagian pertama dapat dibaca pada tautan ini, bagian kedua pada tautan ini, dan bagian ketiga pada tautan ini.Suatu hari, pionir industri dirgantara Indonesia, Prof. Dr. Eng. Baharudin Jusuf Habibie, akan meninggal. Saya rencananya tak akan berkabung.Bentuknya pipih seperti bomber siluman B-2. Namun dengan warna putih dan ukuran yang jauh lebih kecil. Exhibitor yang menjelaskan benda ini pada saya mungkin tidak terlalu fasih dalam menerangkan, namun animasi penjelasan produk yang diputar di layar TV sangat menarik.Pesawat nirawak MiniBe dari PT. Bentara Tabang Nusantra (BETA) ini adalah perangkat utama dari sistem Skyscan, sistem survey aerial untuk mempelajari daratan. Sistem ini dapat digunakan untuk pemetaan, manajemen lahan, studi lahan untuk infrastruktur, perkebunan, kehutanan, atau pertambangan, manajemen bencana, dan lainnya. MiniBe dapat dipasangi kamera infra-merah sehingga dapat membantu militer mendeteksi lawan yang bergerilya di hutan. Pesawat ini juga dapat digunakan secara â€˜swarmâ€™, artinya beberapa unit dapat diprogram untuk digunakan berbarengan dalam satu kegiatan yang sama secara otomatis.Dalam pengembangan pesawat ini, BETA bekerja sama dengan PT. Enrol Sistem Indonesia yang menggembangkan sistem Skyscan dan Swarmscan menggunakan pesawat MiniBe, serta Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika (STEI) ITB yang membantu mengembangkan perangkat telemetri di dalam pesawat MiniBe. Kerjasama ini mengingatkan kembali soal tingkat kerumitan sebuah produk teknologi yang perlu diatasi lewat berkolaborasi dengan berbagai pihak.Jauh dari stand pesawat MiniBe, PT. Cakra Vimana Diinamycx (CVD), ya, saya tidak salah menuliskan kata â€˜Dinamikâ€™, juga memamerkan sebuah pesawat nirawak. Mereka membuat Aerial Target Drone dengan bentuk menyerupai pesawat temput berwarna abu. Awalnya saya salah mengira ini adalah robot pesawat yang dapat menembak target yang jauh secara otomatis, seperti drone yang digunakan Amerika Serikat di Pakistan. Ternyata ini robot pesawat untuk ditembak.Kesannya ironis saat negara lain mebuat robot pesawat untuk menembak, kita malah membuat robot untuk ditembak. Tapi peran pesawat buatan CVD ini tidak kalah penting. Ia digunakan sebagai latihan tembak dan uji amunisi pesawat terbang Angkatan Udara. Dapat dibayangkan jika pada saat pertempuran nyata, pilot pesawat tempur kita tidak terlatih untuk mengejar pesawat musuh atau rudal yang digunakan tidak bekerja sesuai harapan. Agar pembelian pesawat tempur dan amunisi kita tidak mubazir, maka pilot perlu berlatih menggunakan pesawat tempur dan amunisi dalam situasi air-to-air combat (pertempuran di udara melawan pesawat tempur) dengan sasaran berupa Aerial Target Drone ini.Karenanya Aerial Target Drone ini tidak main-main dibuatnya. CVD mengatakan, saat ini pesawat nirawak mereka dapat mensimulasikan kecepatan pesawat SU-35, salah satu pesawat tempur termutakhir dari Rusia. Jadi berlatih menembak pesawat ini sama seperti berlatih menembak pesawat SU-35. Pada perkembangannya nanti, pesawat ini memiliki parasut yang membuka saat ditembak sehingga dapat diambil kembali untuk meneliti daya ledak rudal. Ini produk yang mungkin dipakai sekali, lalu hancur. Jadi militer perlu membelinya dalam jumlah yang banyak untuk latihan. Namun CVD mengatakan, meski produk mereka ini mahal, tapi rudal pesawat lebih mahal lagi. Jadi ini adalah investasi yang menguntungkan, dan perlu, bagi militer.Selain CVD, ada setidaknya 2 exhibitor lain yang mengembangkan pesawat nirawak dengan kelebihan masing-masing. Lembaga Penerbangan dan Antariksa Nasional (LAPAN) memamerkan satu jenis pesawat nirawak nya yang diterbangkan dengan cara ditolakkan lewat semacam ketapel. Berbeda dengan MiniBe yang diluncurkan dengan cara digoyang-goyang dengan moncong ke atas, lalu meluncur vertikal. LAPAN juga mengatakan mereka memiliki berbagai model pesawat nirawak lainnya. Aero Terrascan memiliki pesawat nirawak untuk keperluan mapping dan pengawasan dengan mengandalkan kualitas gambar yang diambil. Model-model pesawat nirawak mereka kebanyakan menggunakan baling-baling quadcopter sehingga dapat terbang secara vertikal dalam kecepatan rendah.Agak tersembunyi dibalik model-model pesawat dari stand-stand di atas, PT. Chroma juga bergerak di bidang penerbangan. Perusahaan yang berdiri sejak tahun 2000 ini menjadi salah satu penyokong untuk industri dirgantara utama seperti desain sistem kendali, pembuatan wind tunnel, pengujian model komponen pesawat, analisis aerodinamika, dll. PT. Chroma juga sudah melayani pasar internasional sejak 2009.Mungkin bintang paling besar di ITD Expo 2019 ini untuk bidang penerbangan adalah PT. Regio Aviasi Industri (RAI). Perusahaan ini adalah yang mendesain pesawat R80; pesawat penumpang regional yang sepenuhnya dibuat di dalam negeri. RAI menampilkan model pesawat R80 dan beberapa komponen pesawat seperti bilah propeller.RAI juga membuat program simulasi penerbangan untuk pesawat R80 ini. Desain pesawat akan diuji berkali-kali lewat simulator untuk dipelajari kekurangan-kekurangannya sebelum dibuat purwarupa yang akan diuji di wind tunnel. Mereka juga membawa perlengkapan simulasi penerbangan tersebut dan mempersilakan pengunjung untuk mencoba melakukan take-off serta landing menggunakan pesawat R80. Saya sempat mencobanya, namun saat akan mencoba take-off, saya agak â€˜diusirâ€™ karena dirjen dikti ingin mencoba simulator.Saya agak tergelitik karena semua perusahan dan lembaga di atas berbasis di Bandung atau sekitarnya. Wajar saja karena perusahaan penerbangan utama nasional, PTDI, dan juga perguruan tinggi yang punya jurusan teknik penerbangan adanya di Bandung. Meski saya juga belum mengerti kenapa kedua hal tersebut adanya di Bandung. Namun saya lebih terkejut lagi karena perusahaan yang bergerak di bidang penerbangan iniâ€¦ banyak. Cukup banyak dari yang sebelumnya saya kira PTDI bergerak nyaris sendiri. Semuanya punya mimpi memajukan industri dirgantara nasional. Semua punya mimpi untuk, terbang.Siapa yang memulai hal ini? Ir. Soekarno atau Prof. BJ. Habibie? Presiden pertama atau ketiga? Yang jelas, atau tepatnya, yang saya yakini, BJ. Habibie yang membawa obor dan menyalakan kepala gelap anak-anak Indonesia dengan sebuah bayangan pesawat terbang. Kepala anak-anak itu sekarang bercahaya sendiri. Prof. BJ. Habibie mungkin sudah selesai dan mengubah segalanya.Suatu hari, medsos, TV, surat kabar, dan mungkin radio akan dipenuhi kabar wafatnya Pak Professor. Saya tidak akan berkabung. Saya akan mensyukuri beliau pernah hidup. Sebab mimpi terbang ini gara-gara beliau.Juga gara-gara Tukul Arwana dan Joshua Suherman.NB: Pak Habibie jangan selesai dulu ya. Semoga sehat selalu dan terus melihat R80 dan turunannya terbang.----Kilodepagossiper of science, tech, and gamingFajar Fauzi HakiminKilodepa--Fajar Fauzi HakiminKilodepa--Fajar Fauzi HakiminKilodepa--Fajar Fauzi HakiminKilodepa--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alex Mathers--220Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Mind you, Iâ€™ve only managed to do that by keeping it down to six stories. Iâ€™ve not had much time to read recently as I started a new job three weeks ago and my commute is much shorter; I used to read four or five articles a day, and Iâ€™m barely managing that a week at the moment. Plenty to catch up on.My new jobâ€™s working in a technical innovation role. Innovationâ€™s often confused (or conflated) with novelty, but sometimes itâ€™s just about combining familiar ideas in an unfamiliar way. David Sax put it well:True innovation isnâ€™t just some magic carnival of invention. It is a continuing process of gradual improvement and assessment. Often that actually means adopting ideas and tools that already exist but make sense in a new context, or even returning to methods that worked in the past.Onto the links! There are some crackers this month â€” including two bests.Notes on AI Bias, Benedict Evans.A seriously clever and clear explanation of bias in machine learning systems â€” and itâ€™s probably not what you think (if you think of it at all).A washing machine is much better than a human at washing clothes, but if you put dishes in a washing machine instead of clothes and press start, it will wash them. Theyâ€™ll even get clean. But this wonâ€™t be the result you were looking for, and it wonâ€™t be because the system is biased against dishes. A washing machine doesnâ€™t know what clothes or dishes are â€” itâ€™s just a piece of automation, and it is not conceptually very different from any previous wave of automation.The Filter Bubble is Actually a Decision Bubble, Thomas Baekdal.People donâ€™t suffer from a lack of exposure to alternative viewpoints, they suffer from excessive exposure to â€˜balancedâ€™ viewpoints.By constantly exposing people to alternative viewpoints, you are teaching the public not to trust anything. Because every single time they read about a fact from one news source, [they will be presented] with an â€˜alternative factâ€™ (for the sake of balance) from another news source. You are telling people that information and facts are a matter of viewpoints, and that there are always alternative facts to be had. Itâ€™s the worst thing you can possibly do.NB: This really annoys me; I wrote about it in How a Google Maps Update Leads to the Promotion of Fringe Views.The Complexity of Grieving in the Digital Age, Debra Bassett.How messages stored on our phones and other devices take on new significance when the sender dies. I love this term: â€œthe socially active deadâ€. After my sister died I always got a little welcome/unwelcome shock when I saw her profile photo in the top scores of Candy Crush.The dead are no longer hidden away, they are carried with us on our digital devices in the form of voicemails, WhatsApp messages, texts and photographs. But these social networks and messaging services were designed for people to stay in touch with the living. Using them to talk with the dead is blurring the distinction between the social lives of the living and those of the â€œsocially active dead.â€The Body Pullers of Syria, Kenneth Rosen.A difficult read, this: how teams of volunteers in Syria locate graves of civilians and ISIS fighters. Every time I read someone from the privileged Western commentariat talk about â€˜burning social media to the groundâ€™ I want to show them stories like this, where social networks enable critical use cases weâ€™ve never been forced to consider.The team uses Google Maps or Google Earth and satellite images to begin to map potential [grave] locations. Once an area is marked as a potential site, the teams use Facebook and WhatsApp to crowdsource more information. They post messages saying they have â€œopenedâ€ (the term of choice) a new mass grave and give its location.Old, Online, And Fed On Lies: How An Aging Population Will Reshape The Internet, Craig Silverman.People aged over 65 make up increasingly large sector of the British and American population, and as they move online theyâ€™re largely moving to Facebook. This is a problem as theyâ€™re the least digitally literate demographic â€” and the most politically active.Since the 2016 election, funding for digital literacy programs has skyrocketed. But they primarily focus on younger demographics, even as the next presidential election grows closer. This means the very people who struggle the most with digital information and technology risk being left to fend for themselves in an environment where theyâ€™re being targeted and exploited precisely because of their vulnerabilities.Why Are People Starting to Purge All of Their Instagram Photos?, Hussein Kesvani.The generation thatâ€™s grown up on social media use it quite differently from the generations which had it appear in their lives. How many of the fears we have about teens and social media are down to us projecting our own experiences?Older generations grew up on platforms where you upload whole photo albums from a party, which probably still exist on Facebook. But teenagers today donâ€™t view photos in that way. Itâ€™s more about capturing a moment immediately, rather than keeping it as a memorial.The Thoughtful Net is an occasional (less than weekly, more than monthly) publication collecting great writing about the internet and technology, culture, information, sociÂ­ety, science, and philoÂ­sophy.

Across email, phone, instant messaging platforms like Slack and Whatsapp, YouTube comments, Blog comments, etc.Example: Trolling and fake reviews for products or services.#PrivacyA loaded term. Itâ€™s also known as data privacy or protection. The big challenge surrounding privacy is how to protect an individualâ€™s identifiable information from third parties such as bank details, contact lists and personal photos online.Where does it happen? As more and more of our lives go online, the way we define date ranges from documents and pictures on our smart phones and laptops, to our browsing history, call history and even purchase history. Other examples of data collected includes: eavesdropping on devices like Google Home, Siri, smart phone cameras and smart phone microphones. It also involves email history, email messages, location trackers and history from maps and fitness trackers, health history, and bank and credit card information stored online.Example: Marriott Hotelâ€™s database got hacked which exposed millions of their guestâ€™s personal information. Read more here.#TheftStealing financial data without consent. Typically refers to hacking with malicious intent and financial gain.Where does it happen? Just like IRL, theft online involves stealing someoneâ€™s personal or business details without their knowledge. Hackers will steal bank or credit card information without the victimâ€™s knowledge through breaching databases or networks.Example: Hacking into someoneâ€™s internet connection without consent or paying.#FraudFraud by means of deception, process and intent. When you are tricked online, on the phone or by other means to reveal important information about your data.Where does it happen? Fraud is anything from scams to phishing, to impersonation and identity theft. Phishing and scams can take place via email, Facebook, Buy/Sell websites like Gumtree or Ebay, or even by telephone. Fraud can also happen inside workplaces when staff steal from an employer.Example: Someone calling you pretending to be your bank provider and getting your details to then use these against you or steal money from your account.#ExtortionThe process of obtaining something (think things like money and services) through force or threats.Where does it happen? Ransomware where someone threatens to delete your data, OR reveal your private data is common. Sadly a lot of vulnerable victims of extortion include health care providers and hospitals â€” all of which tend to give into blackmail because otherwise patients are at risk.Example: Popular female celebrities like Emma Watson have had their private photos hacked and leaked online. Read more here.#EspionageThe act or practice of obtaining confidential and secret information from organisations or government bodies.Where does it happen? Every country is involved in espionage some way or another to protect themselves. However, there is also corporate espionage (where companies trade secrets) and cyber attacks to access government secrets or military information.Example: The New York Times recently published a case study on how spies from China got the N.S.A.â€™s hacking tools and used them for attacks. Read more here.#ChaosAnother loaded term! At its very core, chaos is acts of complete disorder and confusion.Where does it happen? In terms of cyber, chaos happens when terrorists, hacktivists or even whistleblowers reveal, utilise or disrupt confidential information that has huge negative effects on a society, community or state. Acts of chaos include bringing down important websites (i.e. Government or Banks), bringing down infrastructre like airports, transport systems or power plants down, or even contributing to economic disruption inside financial institutions that make civilians vulnerable.Examples: Have you heard of Julian Assange?ConclusionCategorising and defining cyber attacks is difficult due to their broad and ever-changing nature. One of the many reasons that the huge gap in skills within the cyber security industry is so troubling, is that a lot of forms of attacks that threaten our futures donâ€™t exist yet â€” or, even more worryingly, exist but we simply are not aware of them yet. Plus, with a black market for so-called â€œZero-Day exploitsâ€ allowing anyone to break into anything for the right prace, the lenghts black hat hackers will go to are endless.Want to get involved in Cyber Security?

There are still some factors that everyone needs to be aware of in order to understand Fintech better, though.Opportunities abound when it comes to Fintechâ€™s potential, and the following points are just the tip of the iceberg:Up to 52% of all financial services are available nowadays straight from your smartphone. People can access and transfer their funds at all times. This provides convenience to multiple aspects of their business and private lives. By the year 2020, 90% of smartphone users will have made a mobile payment.Careful and accurate analysis of data is crucial to achieving progress. This practice of data analytics has been largely boosted by the various innovations in Fintech.New businesses and companies have appeared as a result of the rise and development of Fintech. People nowadays distinguish between unicorns, and their subsequent sub-types, along with other financial service providers appearing as a result of the newly created circumstances.People need to be aware of the challenges Fintech is facing as a result of its novel and revolutionary character.Some countries have been quicker to adapt to the newly created conditions than others. Leaving numerous governments at a lack of proper regulations for the new industry and its services.Despite its affirmed reliability, cybersecurity remains a pertinent issue, especially when dealing with online funds transfer. Hence, this point is undisputedly a major challenge for all up-and-coming Fintech establishments.Getting proper funding pushes the industry towards progress. The overall adoption and funding rate has increased on the whole, but Fintech is still facing such difficulties occasionally.Originally published at https://startupily.com on July 4, 2019.----Founder of Startupily | Guest Writer for Influencive & Thrive Global | Author of Mind Influence | Marketing Consultant | https://startupily.com/Safwan Khan--5Safwan Khan--Safwan Khan--Safwan Khan--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Alex Mathers--220Aaron Dinin, PhDinEntrepreneur's Handbook--8Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Basically, Root access enables one to not only access the system files lying at the so-called â€œRootâ€ of the OS but also modify them.Itâ€™s a magic tool to customize, tweak, tamper the OS of an android device to get the best out of it by acquiring root permissions. Magisk not only grants root access but also has various features like systemless root and different modules. Magisk can be well defined as â€œA Magic mask to Alter System Sytemlessly. â€ Some of the key features and modules are explained below:Itâ€™s a feature which allows system modification without notifying the system. Magisk stores modifications in the boot partition instead of modifying the real system files. OS doesnâ€™t detect any tampering and unaware about modifications which makes the Magisk obscure to the system.The â€œSystemlessâ€ method makes it possible. Nowadays many developers use GoogleSafetyNet feature to detect the System modifications so that some actions can be performed for example apps like Google pay app and Netflix uses it to detect and restrict rooted devices from accessing the app.Fixes â€œOk Googleâ€ detection problem on various devicesAlso fixes in call low volume mic issues.As the name suggests it is used to systemize user-installed apps systemlessly.it can be used to un-install system apps which you donâ€™t use.If you want to increase your music listening experience and enhance it then it is the right module for you.

Hackers have followed along, attempting to defeat each new security measure with often novel schemes. In 2017 a Vietnamese company cracked the Apple iPhone Xâ€™s Face ID using homemade masks constructed of 3D-printed plastic, silicone, makeup and cutouts; while identical twin siblings have also managed to dupe such facial recognition systems. These methods however lack practicality, as constructing the masks was complicated and not everyone has a twin brother or sister.Everyone, however, sleeps. And Synced has found a simple way to challenge cutting-edge facial recognition security scans: just point a camera at the unaware subject while they are sleeping.In an experiment conducted by Synced, 13 individuals and 12 flagship smartphones were tested to see whether mobile payment platforms WeChat and Alipay could be accessed by scanning usersâ€™ faces with their eyes closed.Facial recognition technology is becoming mainstream in China, and has been widely adopted for mobile payment systems, where the country is a global leader. Syncedâ€™s aim was not to downgrade tech giantsâ€™ efforts with cutting-edge AI technologies, but to open a discussion on a potential vulnerability â€” accounts could be accessed by exploiting a user who is asleep, drunk, drugged, etc. â€” in order to help prevent potential abuse. We found:Although the number of samples measured in this experiment is small, Synced believes the results do indicate potential security concerns for mobile payment verification systems.A facial recognition system can be defined as a technology for identifying registered users. Depending on the input, the facial recognition algorithm can be either 2D or 3D. The 2D algorithm extracts features such as eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth, but can be affected by large amounts of facial variations from head pose, lighting conditions and facial expressions. More advanced 3D scanning tech collects detailed shape and contour information by projecting a network of infrared dots onto the subjectâ€™s face.3D smartphone cameras were introduced with the iPhone X and its biometric face scanning feature Face ID two years ago. These cameras provide superior sensing ability and enhanced picture quality. Many high-end flagship smartphones are now equipped with 3D cameras.WeChat announced itsfirst facial recognition test integrations in October 2017. Ten months later, the company released an update enabling the face scan payment service for Android devices with 3D cameras. A typical payment workflow is shown below:The WeChat Pay security team told Synced that their mechanism for mobile phone face payment requires smartphone models to meet specific security standards, including 3D structured optical depth camera, comparison computation, and other operations in TEE.The team also stressed that a series of rigorous testing mechanisms have been developed to ensure a secure payment experience, including effective distance & angle, screen recordings, 3D head models and others.Alipay unveiled its face scan payment strategy in 2015 when Alibaba Founder Jack Ma demonstrated a payment system on a smartphone using facial recognition technology at the CeBit conference in Hanover, Germany. The company rapidly expanded its face scan payment system in China over the following two years.To adapt to all smartphone units, particularly those without 3D cameras, Alipay developed distinct 2D and 3D face verification payment systems.An Alipay cooperative application vendor told Synced that to ensure the accuracy of 2D facial recognition, Alipay also takes usersâ€™ financial behavior data, such as consumption habits, credit data, and buying power, into consideration.Alipay initially integrated an AI technique it called â€œliveness detectionâ€ to detect and reject for example a photo or a mask of the userâ€™s face being used to fool the system. Liveness detection had the app prompt users to node, shake their head, open their mouth, etc. as part of the scan and verify process. The additional step however was determined to compromise user experience â€” and Alipay later removed liveness detection.In an emailed response to the experiment information provided by Synced, Alipay said iPhone users can enable â€œgaze recognitionâ€ provided by Apple, which can effectively reject facial recognition when a subjectâ€™s eyes are closed.As we move increasingly into biometric identity and access protocols for a wide variety of apps and digital services, an emerging challenge in the implementation of new AI technologies will be striking a balance between user experience and security.Journalist: Tony Peng | Editor: Michael Sarazen2018 Fortune Global 500 Public Company AI Adaptivity Report is out!Purchase a Kindle-formatted report on Amazon.

And a few days ago I did a talk about doing better talks. There was a young woman in the audience with a question that is following me up to this minute. The question I havenâ€™t really given a deeper thought before. Not once throughout my last 10 years in developer relations.Next few days I took the time to wonder many younger male colleagues of mine, if them looking young has ever been a problem at a tech event. I tried to talk to both more vocal and more silent young males. And you, my dear reader, can answer this question as well: â€œhas your young look ever been a concern for being heard as a speaker at a tech event?â€.This question suddenly overlaid the talk a senior executive at King did. He brought up, that his wife sits on boards of several media companies, and often while being the most senior person in the room, she still has troubles being heard. He suggested that â€œit is not about quality, but about the quantity of women in the roomâ€.Next day I found Kingâ€™s HRBP on the same sunny Barcelona El Prat airport terrace where I was plane watching. I brought up both small stories that youâ€™ve just read to hear her feedback.I am still digesting it all, as I am writing this. In fact, it is the reason why this text is here, why I am going all off my developer relations life stories.The society started discussing diversity, unconscious bias, equality, empathy. So the change is in the process. There are still â€œwhoah she looks so goodâ€ comments under YouTube recordings of female speakers. But theyâ€™re often followed by â€œhow is her look important to the topic of the presentationâ€. Weâ€™re slowly evolving.The topic is so sensitive and so individual, that I donâ€™t feel myself in a position to draw conclusions. But thereâ€™s always a place for a humble opinion, free advice, one of many, possibly relevant, probably not.I always try to look likeable and relevant to my audience: laptop stickers, talking t-shirt, functional backpack, wristbands, geeky pins, something to help people locate me in the crowd. I try to put an easily recognisable profile on me, so people at a given event can easily guess who I am, easily talk to me. So somebody can suggest their friends find me with a one-liner like â€œbold dude with some jewellery in moustacheâ€.Probably my humble advice for young women willing to get audience trust at developer events would be to wear a profile that feels confident and that should be relevant for a given audience. With the keyword being â€œconfidentâ€.I went so many times to Mobile World Congress, always struggled to do anything, each conversation required an elevator pitch: I didnâ€™t care enough to get myself a suit and a trolley bag. Well, people have bias and want to save time and efforts by only talking to people who seem relevant to their immediate goals. I just didnâ€™t fit the expected profile of a telecom manager.If my dear reader feels having something to add to this dialogue, please do so.----Last 12 years: building developer relations at Unity Technologies and KingOlle Pridiuksson--1Olle Pridiuksson--Olle Pridiuksson--Olle Pridiuksson--Alex Mathers--220Unbecoming--764The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Zulie RaneinThe Startup--404HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

According to a recent report published by Market Research Future (MRFR), the global facial recognition market is predicted to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 19.68 percent and reach US$8.93 billion by the end of 2022. Facial recognition integrates multiple technologies including Cloud Technology, Internet of Things, Big Data and Automation.Facial recognition is now mainly used in identity verification to enable accurate comparison and recognition of an individual from a huge database through their facial characteristics. There is no doubt that facial recognition systems have greatly improved the accuracy and efficiency of security verification processes while reducing labour costs, as the technology excels at detecting small but unique facial features that would be overlooked by human eyes.Facial recognition in paymentAlthough fingerprints are currently widely accepted in mobile payment systems, the face is the biometric feature of the future in this area. In 2017 Ant Financial cooperated with Face++ to establish the â€œSmile-to-Payâ€ system at fast food restaurant KFC in Hangzhou, China. A 3D camera scans customersâ€™ faces as they smile for their chicken. This is a totally automated payment process with no KFC employees required.Facial recognition in customs clearanceIn Oct 2018 Hikvision launched a facial verification system which is now integrated into the customs clearance system on the new Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. The systemâ€™s smart facial recognition camera can quickly and accurately recognize a driverâ€™s identity and help staff collect information. With the help of a 180Â° visual detector, the system can also scan for suspicious activities such as smuggling in seconds, compared to the three minutes required for a human search.Facial recognition in airportsIn late 2018 Delta Air Lines partnered with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to establish a biometric airport terminal system in Atlanta. Facial recognition is used in self-check-in, baggage drop, onboarding, and arrivals. Globally, a number of airports are introducing biometric systems for verifying arriving and departing passengers â€” with only a passport, fingerprint and face scan required to pass through an automatic security door.Facial recognition systems can deliver convenience, but also bring privacy concerns which have slowed the techâ€™s wider application. When facial features are recorded there is the possibility this data could be hacked, leaked, or used maliciously to threaten privacy, identity or personal property.Other concerns regard the robustness of the technology itself. Key facial features could be altered or camouflaged by criminals, some people (such as twins) may possess very similar biometric characteristics, and facial characteristics can change due to age, disease or surgery, etc. It remains to be seen how these issues will impact accuracy when scaled and how facial recognition researchers will resolve them. This is one of the biggest challenges in the technologyâ€™s development.Facial recognition will be increasingly combined with other technologies like big data, automation systems, robots, etc, as humans are taken out of the loop. Trials are already underway in staffless hotels, grocery stores and restaurants worldwide. Smart farms have adopted facial recognition systems for recognizing and recording livestock health and activity data.If privacy concerns can be effectively mitigated or eliminated and accuracy improved and stabilized, it seems likely that facial recognition systems will become the new standard for identity verification across a growing range of applications.Author: Shiyuan Jiang | Editor: Michael Sarazen2018 Fortune Global 500 Public Company AI Adaptivity Report is out!Purchase a Kindle-formatted report on Amazon.

The number of materials that go into making todaysâ€™ hardware is mind boggling. A smartphone has well over 60 metals, each with its own unique electrical properties contributing to the pretty shiny slab you hold in the palm of your hand. The most important material by far is Silicon. Silicon is the main ingredient in this tech cocktail. Everything depends on it. Everything.However, the 20th century wasnâ€™t the first time humans used a combination of this metal with a bluish grey luster to completely revolutionize an entire species. We have used this material before and used it throughout our history. Albeit not in its pure form but rather as silica(or silicon dioxide). To know when this was first used we need to rewind the clock by a little bit â€” a geologically barely significant 2.6 million years agoÂ¹. Welcome to the Stone Age.We also need to scale back where our population existed on earth to all of just one valley in the entire worldâ€” The East African Rift Valley, the original silicon valley and the cradle of our species, present day Ethiopia.Our ancestors can be grouped under the term hominins. Hominins consist of modern humans, extinct human species, and our immediate ancestors. Although, the first hominin species â€” Ardipithecus ramidus, pretty wordy I know, has been identified as being 4.4 million years old, it took some time to get this stone age going. Finally, however, it does start and this time period in the human story is identified as the Paleolithic or old stone age(2.6 mil to 250,000 years ago). At this point, our ancestors were just starting to learn how to human, with another hominin Australopithecus garhi starting to use stone tools and Homo habilis beginning to master itÂ².The first stone tools ever constructed were made from materials such as flint, quartzite, chert and volcanic obsidianÂ³. All of these rocks are comprised of silica. These tools were used to butcher animals, for woodworking and for plant cuttingÂ¹. The Paleolithic stone â€œindustryâ€ is divided into two periods-the Oldowan and the Acheulean. The first spans 2.6mil to 1.7mil years ago, and the latter 1.7mil to 1mil years ago by which time this industry was thriving in different parts of the world after the Homo Erectus migrations out of Africa.It is a curious thing, that the material responsible for our technology encompassing almost all of our history, throughout our evolution and used in such primitive ways, from a time that just seems so long ago, is also the material that is now defining our present and taking us into the future.This article is inspired by Chapter 2 of the book Origins: How the Earth Made Us, which I highly recommend getting your hands on.References:[1] https://www.ancient.eu/article/998/stone-age-tools/[2] http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/origins/homo_habilis.php[3] Dartwell, Lewis.

A question we often receive is, â€œwhat restaurants belong on Transparent Kitchen?â€, and we have put a lot of thinking into how we answer this question. Though we have an immense amount of respect for all food service workers, part of our goal in this project is to cultivate an intentional community of restaurants around a handful of principles that we believe will guide the next generation of diners to be more conscious consumers.At the heart of our team, we understand the industry that we serve; not only from reports, statistics and stories, but because we are restaurant people ourselves. We have washed dishes, worked the line, served dining rooms, mixed cocktails, stocked inventory â€” even trained Michelin kitchens. This has given us unique insight into the reality of this work, and we know doing it right means that youâ€™ve chosen to do it the hard way. Thatâ€™s worth celebrating.These are the 4 things we look for when building our community:We lift up independently owned restaurants and groups; a well-conceived idea brought to life through service style, artful decor, ambiance, and each and every dish. These restaurants are pillars of our communities, and they are up against the big marketing dollars of restaurant chains. We want to encourage diners to try something new, explore different cuisines, and support the â€œlittleâ€ guys that are going the extra mile to do it right.2. A Culture of DiningThere is a lot of technology that is changing the way we get our next meal. Delivery services like Skip the Dishes, UberEats and Postmates have created exciting opportunities for restaurants to bring in new revenue, but this is not to the benefit of restaurants that really encourage a culture of dining out. Restaurants put a lot of effort into creating an atmosphere that is intended to be enjoyed â€” from music choice, to how theyâ€™ve trained their staff, to the art of plating dishes. These things canâ€™t be experienced with a takeout container. We want to connect diners with restaurants that will give them a moment to remember, and in doing so, give them the opportunity to meet a neighbour and strengthen their community.3. A Chef in a Scratch KitchenBehind every great dish, there is a chef that has a unique, compelling story. We know that they have hustled through long and thankless shifts, studied diligently, staged around the world and experimented for years to bring that dish to fruition. They have a cooking philosophy developed through these experiences, and they create from scratch as best they can. We know that they survive on their passion. We also know that they rarely get the glory that they deserve. We encourage diners to see the person behind their meals, and we want to introduce you to them.4. Intention Behind Sourcing PracticesLast, but certainly not least, we work with restaurants that have intention behind their sourcing practices. These restaurants contribute to their local economy by supporting trusted local farmers. They have sustainability in mind when they source their seafood. They have ethics in mind when they choose a butcher. They minimize their waste and single-use plastics. Our platform allows our restaurant partners to highlight the suppliers that they trust, and then we build supplier profiles, too. We want to encourage diners to think about where their food is coming from, and we give them an opportunity to learn about products and discover restaurants that align with their values.We know that every restaurant marches to the beat of its own drum â€” we also know that in some ways, somethingâ€™s got to give. For us, itâ€™s all about building a community of restaurants that live by their values, and ensuring that we effectively communicate those values to the diners that share them.Do these criteria sound like a restaurant you know and love?

Not all of this light, however, has to be present at one time â€” which is why skilled photographers can produce images of streaking car lights, stars, and artistic light manipulations called light painting or light graffiti.Iâ€™ve experimented with this concept in the past, and after seeing Matthew Rayfieldâ€™s web app that can make a 3D printer produce dot matrix images, I decided to try it out. Unlike his device, however, I utilized a larger CNC router, and instead of a pen or other traditional drawing element, I used a programmable LED as the â€œpen,â€ with a diffuser made out of â€œclearâ€ PLA.A button on the bottom of the new 3D-printed fixture provides input when it hits the CNC bed in the same way that a marker would apply ink. An Arduino Nano is for control to produce green, red, blue, yellow, or random LED colors. The user can select between these five options with a DIP switch, which is wired to ground, and uses pullup inputs in order to avoid the need for resistors.Code for the project, along with 3D print files for the fixture are found on GitHub, and the build process is laid out in the video below. If you want to try this yourself, youâ€™ll also need to grab files for the magnetic ring â€œClamp-MagnetsDC0.stlâ€, so it can affix to the router.----Engineer, tech writer, content creator, maker of random contraptions for fun and profit.Jeremy S.

Examples of companies that act in this way are Just Eat, which gains from fixed margins determined by the restaurant for which it acts as an intermediary. In the increasingly popular â€œOrder and Deliveryâ€ model, the platform takes over the entire delivery process, building an efficient and branched logistics network that allows the ordered food to arrive to the customer in the shortest possible time and in the best conditions. The greater centrality in the flow of the platform means that it is revenue from the restaurant, through the margin according to the size of the order, both the customer, who will pay a fee on the final price. Deliveroo and Glovoo are examples of companies acting in this way.The success of New Delivery can be explained by 2 demand factors: - they are an economic alternative that allows you to get the quality of a restaurant product without the need to go to the point of refreshment, thus saving on transport and additional costs of the meal.- they solve the problem of many busy people who cannot afford, for time and opportunity reasons, to prepare lunch or dinner at home.Obviously, however, a decisive contribution to the satisfaction of these needs is given by the platform that offers features that lead the consumer to prefer the use and reuse of the same. Among these functions there are the availability of menus of a wide variety of restaurants, to be localized, to obtain discounts and advantages according to the purchases made and, above all, to consult the reviews provided by other users.Globally, according to recent estimates, Grubhub is the company with the largest market share. Immediately behind this, however, there is a giant that comes from a completely different sector: Uber.The highly debated organization created to facilitate the transport of people from a point A to a point B decided a few years ago to enter the world of Delivery with the platform Eats. Although it was seen as a second level business unit compared to the main one, Uber Eats surprised everyone with really interesting results such as the delivery of food with an estimated value of 10 billion by 2019 and with prospects of a surplus of 6 billion next year on the same figure (Forbes). This success is due in the first place to the immense user base date deriving from the transport business and, secondly, to the expensive commission of 30% that imposes on restaurants for each order placed (used in part to pay the driver). Obviously, however, in full Uber style, the aggression of this market has resulted in an excessive increase in operating costs leading to the achievement of significant losses such as that of Q3/2019 of 5.2 billion leading to layoffs within the project Eats.Delivery companies can certainly count on strong scalability. The objectives on which they are working are both on the level of demand, in which it is intended to attack even more the age group of millenials but especially of Generation Z, and on the level of supply.The strategies for improving the value proposition are in fact the simplification and widening of payment methods (Tweet/ Virtual Assistant/SmartWatch), the improvement of delivery methods (Droni/Robots), the increase in the offer of restaurants within the catalogue and the extension of the supply chain to the cooking phase through partnerships with restaurants, as in the case of FoodPanda and PostMates, or through own kitchens (Munchery, SpoonRocket).These programs will serve above all to combat various problems that afflict and will afflict the delivery companies: the excessive cost structure and the initiative of some chains, such as McDonaldâ€™s, which has purchased a start up that deals with Big Data, to build its own delivery networks in order to avoid the commissions imposed by intermediaries.In addition, there are also disputes with riders, which are becoming increasingly topical in various countries around the world such as Australia, where Uber, Foodora and Deliveroo have been accused of exploitation (the minimum wage in Australia is $ 18.93 against $ 4 per hour imposed by the companies). The legal and strategic problems are also accompanied by a scepticism about the quality of the food.Clearly, delievery will be more and more part of our lives, saving us from those days when we may not have â€œ made it in time â€œ to do the grocery shopping, we will still have the opportunity to have the dish at the table in a short time. Nevertheless, I personally believe that it is unlikely to achieve the ultimate goal of replacing the very idea of a restaurant. This is because people donâ€™t go to this place simply because they just want to eat something, but to immerse themselves in an experience.----Iâ€™m just a man who wants to express all his passion for business and technology by writing the most useful articles about current and future trends!Stefano ZambriniinBeLeopard--Stefano Zambrini--Stefano Zambrini--Stefano Zambrini--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"
493,8600,https://medium.com/@anabmap/open-data-governance-and-open-governance-interplay-or-disconnect-13d69a7bf7d0?source=tag_archive---------59-----------------------,Open data governance and open governance: interplay or disconnect?,None,Ana Brandusescu,https://medium.com/,8,34,2,"Ana BrandusescuFollow--2ListenShareAuthors: Ana Brandusescu, Carlos Iglesias, Danny LÃ¤mmerhirt, Stefaan Verhulst (in alphabetical order)The presence of open data often gets listed as an essential requirement toward â€œopen governanceâ€. For instance, an open data strategy is reviewed as a key component of many action plans submitted to the Open Government Partnership. Yet little time is spent on assessing how open data itself is governed, or how it embraces open governance. For example, not much is known on whether the principles and practices that guide the opening up of government â€” such as transparency, accountability, user-centrism, â€˜demand-drivenâ€™ design thinking â€” also guide decision-making on how to release open data.At the same time, data governance has become more complex and open data decision-makers face heightened concerns with regards to privacy and data protection. The recent implementation of the EUâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has generated an increased awareness worldwide of the need to prevent and mitigate the risks of personal data disclosures, and that has also affected the open data community. Before opening up data, concerns of data breaches, the abuse of personal information, and the potential of malicious inference from publicly available data may have to be taken into account. In turn, questions of how to sustain existing open data programs, user-centrism, and publishing with purpose gain prominence.To better understand the practices and challenges of open data governance, we have outlined a research agenda in an earlier blog post. Since then, and perhaps as a result, governance has emerged as an important topic for the open data community. The audience attending the 5th International Open Data Conference (IODC) in Buenos Aires deemed governance of open data to be the most important discussion topic. For instance, discussions around the Open Data Charter principles during and prior to the IODC acknowledged the role of an integrated governance approach to data handling, sharing, and publication. Some conclude that the open data movement has brought about better governance, skills, technologies of public information management which becomes an enormous long-term value for government. But what does open data governance look like?To expand our earlier exploration and broaden the community that considers open data governance, we convened a workshop at the Open Data Research Symposium 2018. Bringing together open data professionals, civil servants, and researchers, we focused on:In this session, open data governance was defined as the interplay of rules, standards, tools, principles, processes and decisions that influence what government data is opened up, how and by whom. We then explored multiple layers that can influence open data governance.In the following, we illustrate possible questions to start mapping the layers of open data governance. As they reflect the experiences of session participants, we see them as starting points for fresh ethnographic and descriptive research on the daily practices of open data governance in governments.Governments may decide about the release of data on various levels. Studying the management side of data governance could look at decision-making methods and devices. For instance, one might analyze how governments gauge public interest in their datasets â€” through data request mechanisms, user research, or participatory workshops? What routine procedures do governments put in place to interact with other governments and the public? For instance, how do governments design routine processes to open data requests? How are disputes over open data release settled? How do governments enable the public to address non-publication? One might also study cost-benefit calculations and similar methodologies to evaluate data, and how they inform governments what data counts as crucial and is expected to bring returns and societal benefits.Understanding open data governance would also require to study the ways in which open data creation, cleaning, and publication are managed itself. Governments may choose to organise open data publication and maintenance in house, or seek collaborative approaches, otherwise known from data communities like OpenStreetMaps.Another key component is funding and sustainability. Funding might influence management on multiple layers â€” from funding capacity building, to investing in staff innovations and alternative business models for government agencies that generate revenue from high value datasets. What do these budget and sustainability models look like? How are open data initiatives currently funded, under what terms, for how long, by whom and for what? And how do governments reconcile the publication of high value datasets with the need to provide income for public government bodies? These questions gain importance as governments move towards assessing and publishing high value datasets.Open governance and management: To what extent is management guided by open governance? For instance, how participatory, transparent, and accountable are decision-making processes and devices? How do governments currently make space for more open governance in their management processes? Do governments practice more collaborative data management with communities, for example to maintain, update, verify government data?The interplay between legal and policy frameworks: Open data policies operate among other legal and policy frameworks, which can complement, enable, or limit the scope of open data. New frameworks such as GDPR, but also existing right to information and freedom of expression frameworks prompt the question of how the legal environment influences the behaviour and daily decision-making around open data. To address such questions, one could study the discourse and interplay between open data policies as well as tangential policies like smart city or digitalisation policies.Implementation of law and policies: Furthermore, how are open data frameworks designed to guide the implementation open data? How do they address governmental devolution? Open data governance needs to stretch across all government levels to unlock data from all government levels. What approaches are experimented with to coordinate the implementation of policies across jurisdictions and government branches? To what agencies do open data policies apply, and how do they enable or constrain choices around open data? What agencies define and move forward open data, and how does this influence adoption and sustainability of open data initiatives?Open governance of law and policy: Besides studying the interaction of privacy protection, right to information, and open data policies, how could open data benefit from policies enabling open governance and civic participation? Do governments develop more integrated strategies for open governance and open data, and if so, what policies and legal mechanisms are in place? If so, how do these laws and policies enable other aspects of open data governance, including more participatory management, more substantive and legally supported citizen participation?Governments may have different technical standards in place for data processing and publication, from producing data, to quality assurance processes. Some research has looked into the ways data standards for open data alter the way governments process information. Others have argued that the development of data standards is reference how governments envisage citizens, primarily catering to tech-literate audiences.(Data) standards do not only represent, but intervene in the way governments work. Therefore, they could substantially alter the ways government publishes information. Understood this way, how do standards enable resilience against change, particularly when facing shifting political leadership?On the other hand, most government data systems are not designed for open data. Too often, governments are struggling to transform huge volumes of government data into open data using manual methods. Legacy IT systems that have not been built to support open data create additional challenges to developing technical infrastructure, but there is no single global solution to data infrastructure. How could then governments transform their technical infrastructure to allow them to publish open data efficiently?Open governance and the technical / standards layer: If standards can be understood as bridge building devices, or tools for cooperation, how could open governance inform the creation of technical standards? Do governments experiment with open standards, and if so, what standards are developed, to what end, using what governance approach?Staff innovations may play an important role in open data governance.What is the role of chief data officers in improving open data governance? Could the usual informal networks of open data curators within government and a few open data champions make open data success alone? What role do these innovations play in making decisions about open data and personal data protection? Could governments rely solely on senior government officials to execute open data strategies? Who else is involved in the decision-making around open data release? What are the incentives and disincentives for officials to increase data sharing? As one session participant mentioned: â€œI have never experienced that a civil servant got promoted for sharing dataâ€. This begs the question if and how governments currently assess performance metrics that support opening up data. What other models could help reward data sharing and publication? In an environment of decreased public funding, are there opportunities for governments to integrate open data publication in existing engagement channels with the public?Open governance and capacity: Open governance may require capacities in government, but could also contribute new capacities. This can apply to staff, but also resources such as time or infrastructure. How do governments provide and draw capacity from open governance approaches, and what could be learnt for other open data governance approaches?With this map of data governance aspects as a starting point, we would like to conduct empirical research to explore how open data governance is practised. A growing body of ethnographic research suggests that tech innovations such as algorithmic decision-making, open data, or smart city initiatives are â€˜multiplesâ€™ â€” meaning that they can be practiced in many ways by different people, arising in various contexts.With such an understanding, we would like to develop empirical case studies to elicit how open data governance is practised. Our proposed research approach includes the following steps:This may surface how open data governance becomes salient for governments, under what circumstances and why. If you are a government official, or civil servant working with (open) data, and would like to share your experiences, we would like to hear from you!(Reposted from https://blog.okfn.org/2019/02/20/open-data-governance-and-open-governance-interplay-or-disconnect/)----2Researcher.

Sure, wired inspection scopes exist, but you can only move them so far and navigating in cramped areas can be very difficult. A robot dramatically extends that range and allows you to move around unhindered. The tricky part, of course, is building a robot small enough to actually fit into those small areas. Thatâ€™s what IOXIDE has done with their Nano FPV Tank Inspection Bot, and the results are impressive.The finished robot measures a mere 65x40x30mm, which makes it one of the smallest FPV (First-Person View) robots weâ€™ve ever seen. It started its life as an inexpensive Happy Cow 777â€“215 RC Tank. Mechanically, that RC tank had pretty decent parts right off the shelf. But the control electronics were woefully inadequate for any kind of real work. So, IOXIDE kept the chassis, motors, and tracks, but tossed out everything else.They then put in an much nicer RC receiver and electronic speed controllers (ESCs) for the motors. While they were at it, they also added a tiny camera FPV system to transmit a video signal back to the pilot. Finally, a new shell was 3D-printed to protect the robot tank. As IOXIDE shows, the robot is remarkably nimble. The video quality is also surprisingly good considering how small the camera is. With some LED headlights, itâ€™s able to easily navigate through dark, cramped spaces for inspections.----Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_cowardCameron Coward--Cameron CowardinSerial Hobbyism--Cameron Coward--Cameron Coward--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Michael James Wilson--Enrique DansinEnrique Dans--6Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Clive Thompson--19HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Policymakers in government and industry are actively seeking solutions. Google has founded a global advisory council to consider ethics in AI and other disruptive technologies, Facebook last week announced it is banning white nationalist content across its platforms, and the UK has begun an investigation into discriminative decisions made by AI in multiple industries. A new survey however has surprised many with its finding that a large portion of respondents believe AI can make better policy decisions than politicians. Whether this reflects emerging confidence in AI or general distrust of politicians remains unclear. In any case it seems policymakers have work to do.March 27 â€” Google Launches Global Council to Advise on AI and Tech EthicsMarch 27 â€” Facebook Announces New Policy to Ban White Nationalist ContentLeyi Hu â€” Analyst, Global IndustryMedical robots and AI are expected to become increasingly active in assisting physicians during surgery. Over the last two weeks, Intuitive Surgical announced FDA approval for the use of its da Vinci SP surgical system, Chinese medical robot company TMiRob completed a B+financing round, and the Singapore National Research Fund pledged to spend an additional S$540 million (US$400 million) to spur medical advances using AI and robotics. A number of issues however are arising. Many patients and their families remain skeptical regarding the use of medical robots in surgery. Also, the expected easing of physiciansâ€™ workloads hasnâ€™t yet been realized, in part because they are spending time learning how to cooperate with robots and communicate with patients to explain robotic-surgery processes. Because current medical education does not adequately prepare physicians for the artificial intelligence healthcare era, there is an urgent need to overhaul both education and related regulations.March 28 â€” S$540m Kitty to Spur Medical Advances Using AI, RoboticsMarch 18 â€” Intuitive Surgical da Vinci SP Gets FDA Nod, Prospects BrightMarch 28 â€” MOV.AI Autonomous Logistics Robots Improve Portugal Postal Servicesâ€™ Parcel Sorting ProcessMarch 27 â€” Dubai Digital Bank Liv Launches AI-powered Chatbot OliviaMarch 27 â€” Volkswagen Partners with Amazon on IoT and Machine Learning ServicesMarch 26 â€” Kindredâ€™s Intelligent Picking Robot Overcomes Supply Chain Challenges with AI TechnologyMarch 25 â€” SPF Private Clients Introduces AI Mortgage AdviserMarch 22 â€” Machine Learning Model Learns How Individual Amino Acids Determine Protein FunctionMarch 21 â€” First Details of Maltaâ€™s Artificial Intelligence Policy AnnouncedMarch 20 â€” EU Fines Google â‚¬1.49B for Antitrust Behavior on Ad PlatformMarch 19 â€” Conversocial Acquires AI-Powered Conversational Commerce Platform AssistMarch 18 â€” Stanford Launches Institute for Human-Centered Artificial IntelligenceStay tight with AI!

Right!Today letâ€™s change a little bit the topic and talk about that thing which blows all universe, â€” Technology.In preparation for Bootcamp, I learned a lot than I expected in a short period. Though some of the tools and technologies were new to me, I managed to acquaint myself with them through hard work, and help from LFA (Learning Facilitator Assistant) @Joseph KASULE, team members and fellow Andelans.MochaTo be honest, I found this tool funny when I heard it for the first time, you will ask me why. Right!Well, the name â€” mocha, a fine-quality coffee, â€” the purpose, writing codes which test codes! â€” assertion library, chai. Really? ðŸ˜‰Why mochaIn the past, to write codes I was not taking caution of whatâ€™s errors could be found in my app. I was just writing codes and deliver to other people to test on their devices. But with mocha, I know ahead of time which errors could get fired if the user enters certain data.The interesting part of mocha is that it is related to a real-life scenario where you are expecting something to happen the way you want them to happen then you do what you intended to do.Whatâ€™s mochaI talked about mocha, letâ€™s now get the definition of mocha from their website.Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.Other toolsHere is a list of other tools that I encountered and found interested if you want to become a world-class software developerConclusionTo build a profound career in software development, there are plenty of tools that can use and help to boost your knowledge. Technology is growing at a fast pace, and you have to be updated with a tool that is popular.Mocha is mostly used and become a popular tool in Nodejs environment to test RESTful APIs.I enjoyed the time I spent to learn it and I choose it as my powerful testing framework.I hope you will also enjoy using it.Thank you for reading.If you find this article interesting share it on twitter or facebook with your friends.You can also read :How I recently demonstrated a growth mindsetMy reflections on Andela EPIC values----Software DeveloperEliezer Basubi--Eliezer Basubi--Eliezer Basubi--Eliezer Basubi--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Unbecoming--764Alex Mathers--220Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

We see it in Core coin (BTC). Core coin implemented radical changes to the Bitcoin protocol, and instead of launching as a new system defrauded consumers in leading them to believe that they had bitcoin.Forks occur.

Studying in the Canadian education system has its perks â€” getting co-op internship experience is, according to me, a core part of the university experience.I completed my first co-op job at AppNeta just a few weeks ago. AppNeta develops network performance management solutions for enterprise customers in the SaaS world, and was recently named as a â€˜Visionaryâ€™ in Gartnerâ€™s Magic Quadrant for network performance monitoring. I worked as a software engineer in one of their five engineering teams in Vancouver, for the last 8 months, and I learned a lot along the way.Reflecting back, here are 5 things I learned during my first internship:Making a project at school usually involves writing a couple of lines of code, maybe a few different files and some dependencies. A lot of us use GitHub for our projects, and thatâ€™s a great tool. But in a production environment, there is a lot more to it.I was initially overwhelmed by the amount of code written for a web app. From the hundreds of different components for every small feature in the UI, to a big Java project that handles back-end processing, to multiple API endpoints to connect the stack, there was too much code to digest.The most important part of being productive is knowing what you are doing, what your goals are, and where you stand in terms of progress towards those goals. Agile is a common methodology for tracking progress and setting expectations, as well as communicating with the team and documenting your work.At AppNeta, we followed the Agile processes. We had daily stand-ups to update our team on our progress and blockers. We also had 2-week sprints and planning meetings.As it was my first time following this process, it took me a few weeks to understand what each meeting was about and how it helped us be a productive team. But I noticed the perks from day one â€” I knew what my team members were working on. I had a place and time to share where I am blocked, and where I can get help.As an intern who is present in the company for only 4â€“8 months, you need to ramp up quickly in order to be productive. So, you can expect a ton of on-boarding sessions and meetings in the first week. Even with all that effort, you only show signs of productivity by the end of your first month. In my case, the latter was true, but I was fully productive and independent only around month three.On-boarding will be a big chunk of your time and it is your responsibility to make the most out of it.ðŸ“ˆ Tips:Okay, I might be biased here, but startups and small tech companies are insanely fun to work at. Not only do you learn a lot, but you get to explore a variety of aspects of product development â€” from research to dev-ops. Moreover, engineering-heavy companies have a casual culture that gives you the time and freedom to explore and hone your passions in code.Working at AppNeta made me realize what I enjoy and what I donâ€™t. I tried a bit of everything, including participating in design and front-end development, as well as backend and systems operations. I eventually understood that I enjoy front-end development a lot more than backend, and I had the freedom to choose the types of tasks I wanted to do.But there is more to it than code. Most companies have lunch-time activities and games. Over 8 months, I learned to play foosball and various card games. I took part in Christmas activities and enjoyed the parties and dinners with my colleagues and fellow interns.As a new batch of interns came in after four months, I was able to mentor and help them as they picked up their projects. This was a reflective and rewarding process.All in all, it was incredible. And if you are starting an internship soon, I am sure it will be incredible for you too.â€”I am glad I chose AppNeta as my first company for co-op. I loved the culture, dedication to the product, and the skills and experience of my team members, from whom I learned a lot of the processes and techniques I still apply in my day-to-day work. A big shout-out to my team and colleagues for making my 8 months so memorable!If you are looking into the co-op program, I highly recommend you sign up and do it. Yes, it means fewer holidays and longer university life, but it is ðŸ’¯ worth it. By the time you graduate, you will know what you want to do, and your resume will shine. Plus, who knows, you might love a company you worked at and you can choose to go back as a full-time employee after you graduate!If you have any questions about co-op, or if you want more tips and answers, drop them in the comments below âœŒï¸www.appneta.comsciencecoop.ubc.ca----TechnonerdsCS at UBC | Computer Vision Researcher | PhotograperAditya ChinchureinTechnonerds--3Aditya ChinchureinTechnonerds--1Aditya ChinchureinTechnonerds--1Aditya ChinchureinTechnonerds--4The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Alex Mathers--220Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Unbecoming--764Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

We must be clear on the fact that the technology itself does now equal to a digital transformation. The customer, company culture, employees along with the business continuity should work together to leverage and invest in the opportunities of technology. The technology itself is just an enabler on which we can build opportunities on. When distributors enter market, it hurts the big players. They will not be able to get back to the same level as they were, unless they will adapt.As Nikola Pleska from Microsoft has mentioned, with every decade of innovation, there is always one â€œinnovationâ€ that stands out and changes the era. Think of steam operated machines, electricity in 1870 or first computers in 1970. In 21st century it is data, and we all have data to start with already and we should all make â€œintelligent movesâ€.Yesterday, Prague hosted DOTS 2019 â€” Digital Opportunities Transformation Summit, which I have been watching live online. The summit was divided into 4 pillars of digital transformation.1. Firms and their business as usual2. Employees3. Products and services4. CustomersThe most prosperous brands are successful due to three factors that they should keep at the heart of any activities and communications:- Meaningfulness (emotionally and functionally, to what extend they can connect with users)- Differentiation point (the added value, to what extend are they offering something different and going in the different directions)- Power of Awareness (the right mixture of traditional and digital technology to build an image)If you are interested to watch the full conference, check the streaming link here (please note that the conference is predominantly in Czech):https://attend-noam.broadcast.skype.com/en-US/72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47/a97e6279-1566-4f3d-934c-4960f8142253/player?cid=nhmz4ekiv4hdnd5mp7xcpbjpxkhecjh7ijx5xxtpez4wljhoisoq&rid=NOAMCame across also Forbes article with 2019 digital transformation trends which is worth to share with you instead of me re-phrasing it:https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2018/09/11/top-10-digital-transformation-trends-for-2019/#14eb5cfb3c30----Multicultural explorer, digital enthusiast, marketer and digital transformation consultant at AND DigitalThuy Phamova--Thuy Phamova--1Thuy Phamova--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Move over WiFi, now it is LiFi!",None,Daddys Code,https://medium.com/@daddyscodeinfo,3,0,"1, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*smfRbn-oiqhpM-akirHh0A.jpeg","Daddys CodeFollow--ListenShareWhat if we tell you that you will start receiving data at the speed of light? Impossible? No, we do not think so. Let us introduce LiFi to you that is a revolution in data transfer technology.LiFi is Light Fidelity that uses light spectrum technology to transmit data instead of radio frequencies. Wireless data is embedded in an LED light beam. A receptor converts this beam of light into an electrical signal and then to data. The data is sent back by the device using invisible light.LiFi offers valuable benefits like high speed, increased security and efficiency when compared to a WiFi data transfer.The term LiFi was introduced by Prof. Harald Haas, CSO of pureLiFi, at TedGlobal Talk in 2011 where a demonstration of it was first given.This wireless visible light communications (VLC) technology works through a network of LED bulbs, photodiode, amplifier, input transmitter, and a timer circuit.On passing electric current, an LED bulb emits photons. The light flowing through the bulb is modulated at different rates to enable the sending of signals. A detector interprets this change in light intensity and converts them into data. Since the light modulation (flickering of light) takes place at very high speeds, it cannot be perceived by the human eye. It will appear as a steady source of light streaming from the LiFi-enabled LED.1. Bi-directional communication- LiFi uses infra-red (IR) those are the invisible parts of the light spectrum to send back signals from the user device. Thus LiFi enables both downlink and uplink communication.2. Data Security- Unlike radio frequencies as in WiFi, LiFi works on the light wavelength that cannot penetrate a physical boundary. This means that your data is secure within your four walls.3. Anywhere, Everywhere- Your LED streetlight could also be possibly used to transmit data signal. With proper infrastructure, private and public light systems can be transformed into LiFi hotspots.4. Less interference- Whereas a radio frequency has varied interferences, LiFi signals can be restricted and controlled avoiding interference. Thus it can be conveniently used in power plants, defense, and flights.5. Increased efficiency- With LiFi, there is no necessity to share wireless bandwidth thus enabling it to achieve 1000 times more data density than WiFi.6. Reduced Costs- LED bulbs used for lighting purposes at your home or office are used for LiFi purpose thus reducing your investment costs.Â· Data networks that work on radio frequencies can be transmitted and received anywhere even on the go. But it is not possible with LiFi technology. Data transfer is limited to Line-of-Sight (LOS).Â· If LiFi has to work, the lights have to be turned on constantly. The lights can be dimmed but cannot be switched off if you are to receive the signal.1. Smart Homes- Reliable wireless communications that can be secured and designed for the best coverage locations.2. VR and AR- Faster speeds to enhance the AR-VR experience.3. Transport- Can be used to augment wireless technologies for safe driving.4. Industries- For secure communication systems without interference in signals like in health and banking.5. Enterprises- For enhanced user-experience in video streaming. Off-loading to LiFi means spectrum release for other devices that need a WiFi connection.6. E-Commerce- E-Commerce website loads faster and provides a better user experience.LiFi is still in its nascent stage and it cannot replace WiFi fully. But when used as a complement to WiFi, LiFi works to your advantage.----Daddys Code is an upcoming IT solution provider based in Surat, India.

A miner is usually rewarded with new Bitcoins every 10 minutes.The number of Bitcoins that the miner is rewarded with, which is referred to as the Bitcoin reward per block, normally reduces by half every 210,000 blocks. Averagely, to mine this amount of blocks, it would take 4 years; therefore, after every 4 years, the Bitcoin reward per block is halved.The first Bitcoin reward per block was 50 Bitcoins, but the value has reduced significantly with time and currently, the reward is 12.5 Bitcoins for every block mined. The last halving took place in 2016 and it is expected that the next 4 years will be coming to an end at 2020, from when the reward shall be 6.25 Bitcoins per mined block.Effects of the Bitcoin reward per block halvingThe halving of the rewards, of course, reduces the number of new Bitcoins supplied to the blockchain network. However, as the supply of Bitcoins is reduced, the users continue to increase due to the continued adoption of the cryptocurrency.With high demand and low supply of coins, investors are most likely to start competing to get the Bitcoins, which will most likely drive the prices of the digital coins to new highs.By 2020, more governments, industries, organizations, and individuals are expected to have adopted Bitcoin and cutting its supply short means the users will have to sweat to get Bitcoin. In this case, most of the Bitcoins supplied to the new users will have to come from the existing users who will tend to hold on their coins dearly thus pushing the prices higher.Experts are actually linking the current Bitcoin price hike to the anticipated halving arguing that investors have spotted an opportunity which makes them want to buy more Bitcoin currently so that they may have enough to sell when that time comes. In a way, this theory holds water although some still argue that the price hike could be somehow related to the ongoing China-US trade war.But in any case, whatever the reason for this price hike, investors should expect the prices to even shoot higher in the coming two years (that is 2020 and 2021). Everyone can remember what happened in 2016 and 2017. Actually, Bitcoin registered one of the highest prices then and if things work out just exactly as expected, the digital coin could be taking the investors for another ride to the moon very soon.----Bitvalex is a one-stop-shop cryptocurrency wallet and exchange platform that aims to provide a true banking alternative.BitvalexinThe Capital Platform--BitvalexinThe Capital Platform--BitvalexinThe Capital Platform--BitvalexinThe Capital Platform--PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Jayden LevittinLevel Up Coding--38Unbecoming--764Jon CrabbinCoinmonks--22HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

That is very shallow description of all the variations there could exist with different software layers and hardware layers, different devices, types of applications and use cases.If the users of your creations are Business-to-Business the UI layer may be indeed simple â€” just browser or a simple app. Business clients generally have good Internet connection and speed and are more focused on the logic behind and the positive Business impact of the software + hardware.If the end users are Customers, than â€” the User Experience is very, very top priority. Today, building interfaces even in the browser is more like app development thanks to HTML5 APIs and PWA. You should handle bad or no internet connection â€” functionality, you should cache and optimize for speed, you should do whatever possible on the client-side.Besides the browser â€” there are different mobile platforms and devices. Native will forever be the fastest in terms of speed and smallest in terms of application size. There are also speakers with a wi-fi adapter â€” that could be the next big â€œInterfaceâ€ to the User. What if Musk (or someone else) creates a chip that attaches somehow to the human brain and enhances the human to input and output directly to the devices around him and the Internet in high speed â€” without keyboard, mouses, touchable and non-touchable screens, and speakers? Will you feel lost â€” that time youâ€™ve developed endlessly â€” yet another UI and application?There are some good problems that the back-end developers solve:Probably in most server applications out there â€” there is no multi-flow work and data processing in the logic itself â€” as a app developer is written in one â€œlineâ€, one thread, one process no matter that the (HTTP) requests are threads/requests themselves. Actually even with simple Web Application synchronization collisions may occur â€” if opened from different browsers/sessions.I know several developers that have coded multi-threaded, multi-process back-end applications, but that still donâ€™t like front-end development. Front-End development, besides that user interface itself, is very close to a multi-threaded application.Especially nowadays â€” the languages, the frameworks, the design patterns used are probably more than 90% the same and it is not that difficult to learn the next major tendency in this technical direction. It will be just from a different provider, different toolkit, but in the end â€” the same and what you actually build with these tools was, is and will be more important.----Toma Velev--Toma Velev--Toma Velev--Toma Velev--Melih YumakinJavaScript in Plain English--12Reed BargerinWeb Dev Hero--2Hussein Nasser--36Reed BargerinWeb Dev Hero--1Philosophical Techie--14Andreas Sujono--6HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"
516,48430,https://medium.com/@jonathan.lonsdale/the-future-of-brokering-secondaries-1a8bda3e3f10?source=tag_archive---------35-----------------------,The Future of Brokering Secondaries,Adverse incentives of brokers,Jon Lonsdale,https://medium.com/@jonathan.lonsdale,10,11,1,"Jon LonsdaleFollow--ListenShareAnd there is no such thing as a no sale call. A sale is made on every call you make. Either you sell the client some stock or he sells you a reason he canâ€™t. Either way a sale is made, the only question is who is gonna close? You or him? Now be relentless, thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™m done.-Boiler RoomI thought I was done writing about my work as a secondary brokerâ€¦ but since Iâ€™m transitioning out, I might as well make some predictions as to how I see the industry shaping up the next ten years. If youâ€™re reading this in any public medium, Iâ€™ve deregistered and am no longer a broker. Due to the rules/regulations of being a registered representative, itâ€™s extremely difficult or near impossible to express opinions on public forums. Also, I hope the future is cool and things keep getting better.To understand where brokering is going to go, we have to address the misaligned incentives of brokers.Introducing people can make you lose future commissions. This is especially annoying as you want the best for your clients, but if you introduce a seller to a potential investor or even invite them both to the same event, you could lose out on future commissions. My natural inclination is to help people out and introduce themâ€¦ Iâ€™ve enabled hundreds of transactions to take place that I never got a fee on. Brokers are incentivized to hoard/declare ownership of relationships.Overpromise and underdeliver. The most successful brokers Iâ€™ve worked with consistently overpromise and underdeliver. Theyâ€™re extremely charismatic and do what they can to win the mandate. To be a banker, you have to win mandates. You win mandates by confidently promising the best possible outcome. If you fail, you donâ€™t get paid but if you succeed, you get a big pay day. Added bonus is that you get amazing references from the miracles you pull off. Brokers are constantly faking it until they make it. It sucks that itâ€™s this way. Itâ€™s not how I operate, how I want to live my life, or how I see successful people operate in other industries. Last month, if I lied and said I had a buyer to lock up a seller, I would have closed a huge deal. But I told the seller the truth that my buyer wasnâ€™t firm yet, so the seller went with another broker who, incidentally, lied to lock the seller up (I know the other broker lied because they only partially filled the order as the market moved in the brokerâ€™s favor over the next couple months). I completely closed a small trade at the same price with the sellerâ€™s other friend before even half of his deal closed.In Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, the author calls this the â€œLow Ball Techniqueâ€. It works because you get the client committed to working with you. Once theyâ€™re committed to transact, itâ€™s easier to push them on price last minute because the dollar amount is small in comparison to the total deal size.Monetizing relationships. This is more a personal negative. Thereâ€™s something slimey about being a broker. Your relationships are what give you value. You can convince people to invest in good companies, but itâ€™s inherently extractionary. Whatâ€™s most common is becoming close to a few big groups and being their gatekeeper. They trust you, and you charge them and others fees to move their money around. They rationalize this by saying you are helping execute trades, which is true but the broker is being paid a fee and is incentivized only to get them to deploy capital. Many of the most successful brokers I know have a few big groups they work closely with.Optimizing for closing deals, regardless of price. Brokers only get paid when deals close. The standard is for brokers to operate on a flat % fee basis, so if the deal is $5M, the broker doesnâ€™t care about the price per share. The broker cares about any transaction going through and simply finding a price that clears for both sides.Broker Collusion. Say we pushed really hard and this is as far as they can go, say they built our fee into the price, say their IC only approved at up to X price. Basically, any rationale or trigger you can push to make the parties more likely to sign on the dotted line. When brokers work together on a deal, advice of this kind is passed on to try and help their counterpart solidify the price on the other side. Sometimes these excuses are real, which makes it especially hard to call a broker out on this.Poor Execution. Iâ€™ve seen multiple large trades get up to 20% worse prices due to shitty execution. This is mostly due to the nature of secondary markets. Secondary markets can be illiquid and there may only be a few buyers and a few sellers of a company at a given time. When a single buyer uses multiple brokers to find the same stock, the brokers end up reaching out to the same few sellers who are in the market. The sellers then think thereâ€™s a ton of demand as they are getting pinged by multiple brokers asking for their stock. The sellers increase their price. The brokers inform the buyer who then increases their price to try and clear a trade. The brokers all go back to the sellers with demand at the higher price. The sellers then think thereâ€™s a ton of demand as they are getting pinged by multiple brokers asking for their stock at the new high price. The sellers increase the price again. This cycle continues until the buyer has pushed themselves up to their own limit. Itâ€™s hilarious how often this happensâ€¦ and Iâ€™ve seen it happen many times with a single seller talking to multiple brokers who are all talking to the same buyer.Shitty brokers. There are only so many good brokers out there. Investors will only answer the phone for so many people. Only so many people can close deals and have the execution chops. I couldnâ€™t find any stats, but I highly doubt there are over 500 registered broker dealer representatives who individually make over $250K/year in commissions on secondary tech shares. The issue is that I donâ€™t think there are that many successful brokers out there. Brokering doesnâ€™t attract the most honest people. Thereâ€™s a ton of noiseâ€¦ Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s more extreme than the typical 80/20 rule.Auctions fail. Secondary markets operate similar to a slower moving public marketâ€¦ how slow depends on how easy it is to transact in the issuer and the amount of publicly available data. Similar to public markets, stocks are still volatile in between earnings announcements. Itâ€™s a slow market, but it doesnâ€™t give enough time for weeklong auctions.Auctions wonâ€™t work or become a thing in the secondary marketâ€¦ at the bottom of this post, you can read an edited email I sent to a seller who was considering an auction with Nasdaq Private Markets (NPM). Spoiler alert â€” the seller went with the auction anyway, and they failed to get the get the best price or even fill the entire allocationâ€¦ same as every other auction Iâ€™ve seen tried in the secondary market.Platforms. I think a few dominant platforms will emerge that connect brokers, buyers, and sellers. Each will have their own niche of smaller trades, structured trades, or institutional facing. As discussed, structured secondary trades are typically the loan sharks. The group that solves it for institutions will be the big winner. As large secondaries become more and more a thing and bulge bracket bank compliance teams finally catch up, one inter-dealer broker platform (IDB) will emerge.The other platform that will be a decent sized winner in the space will be the platform that matches existing investors with others on the cap table who want to sell. This is currently done through brokers which always felt silly to me. Iâ€™m skeptical of a cap table management companyâ€™s capabilities of building this platform as itâ€™s a fundamentally different business and skill set needed vs building cap table management software. A cap table management company partnering with brokers makes the most sense.Large and small firms hiring in-house brokers. In-house brokers are the future. The same way firms hire in-house legal counselâ€¦ after a certain point, it will become significantly cheaper to hire an in-house broker than to work with outside brokers. The only reason companies havenâ€™t done this yet is that itâ€™s not standard at the moment. The costs per transaction are way too high for groups who liquidate shares or purchase secondary shares. VC funds are allowed up to 20% of their AUM to purchase secondary shares. If a fund does one big deal a year, the commissions they pay on the buy/sell side are worth hiring one person full time to execute those transactions. The hard part is that brokers often make too much money to be hired, but I think some experienced brokers would prefer a consistent lifestyle over the volatility of the brokerage business. This helps align the broker to the firm theyâ€™re working at, and if they have to work with other brokers, they actually understand the broker incentives and know how to manage them and negotiate better deals. Itâ€™s very similar to a lawyer going in-house from a law firm. Working at a law firm is hectic with crazy hours and unstable clients, while working in-house generally pays less but is more fulfilling and a better work life balance.LPs love to ask VCs their thoughts on the big upcoming tech IPOs and late stage companies. The in-house broker could opine on these topics. From time to time, they may even be able to drum up enough interest to do SPVs with the existing LP base.The broker could also advise on the true value of their portfolio â€” itâ€™s standard practice for VCs to mark companies at their latest preferred financing price per share. In reality, early preferred shares are basically the same as common shares. If a VC were to liquidate their entire portfolio, it would be at a significant discount to where theyâ€™re marked. This isnâ€™t a huge value add, but itâ€™s something I think about whenever I get updates on funds Iâ€™m an LP in.These three functions alone would more than pay for the cost of a competent in-house broker at a fund. The main pushback is that broker fees arenâ€™t paid out of management fees. Poor returning funds who hoard management fees and donâ€™t value carry, will be the last to hire an in-house broker.Weâ€™re already seeing some brokers go in-house. The top broker at Forge recently left to Coatue. Maybe they left because of all the sketchy forward purchase contracts eventually coming to roost but who knows. Going in-house gets rid of all the adverse incentives of being a broker, which benefits the broker and the fund. Aligned incentives are the best.Edited email about auction mechanics.The auction sounds great in theory if there was only one source of available shares, and itâ€™s a controlled process. But there are numerous other sellers out there and buyers have choice. The issue is that auction mechanics for one off secondary transactions donâ€™t work very well because things move too fast â€” especially when itâ€™s non-exclusive.I outline some of the major issues with the auction below:Companies typically donâ€™t like auctions. We work with many large companies and some of their management teamsâ€¦ one their biggest annoyances is noise in the secondary markets. The finance team may not be pleased to hear about an auction of an employeeâ€™s secondary shares. It can create a massive amount of noise in the secondary market and auditors (who determine the 409a price) may also take notice.Timing â€” the market can move significantly in six weeks. Six weeks is frankly a very long to sell a one-off block of secondary, especially with current market volatility. This given timeframe leads me to believe that they are going to spam many groups who will ignore their email.Most sophisticated buyers wonâ€™t participate in auctions. Especially when theyâ€™re non-exclusive. This is due to how institutions work â€” they get approval from their IC and as soon as they get approval, their teamâ€™s job is to execute trades as soon as possible at the best available price. In some cases, they may pay above market to fill the trade.I know groups who have tried the auction model for one off secondaries in the past. It ended up being a waste of time for everyone involved and hurt the sellersâ€™ relationships with the issuer.When NPM is given tender allocation (usually theyâ€™re just the compliance software and not given allocation), they attempt to fill their allocation by syndicating to brokers and investors. I assume this auction service will work the same. NPM will likely be ignored as theyâ€™re seen as compliance software, but itâ€™ll be spammed around. This could create the illusion of artificial supply in the ecosystem with different brokers pinging the same buyers many times over. It needs to be a tightly managed process where they make every broker disclose every buyer theyâ€™re talking to. This takes a lot of coordination, and I doubt theyâ€™ll spend the time to do this even if they say they will.A better way to think of this secondary auction mechanic is a startupâ€™s new service where youâ€™re playing the guinea pig, when many services like it have failed in the past. They charge you a lower fee because itâ€™s pure upside on potentially getting paid for an alpha launch. Thereâ€™s no downside for NPM here. This one off secondary auction service will probably not exist a year from now.Fun fact: This is one of numerous emails, phone calls, and video chats with this seller. NPM eventually reduced their fee to 1%, and the auction timing to one week. This seller went with the NPM auction for a portion of their shares, and they got a worse net price than they would have in the private market during that time. The seller apologized after.----Investor, advisor, filmmaker turned Austin startup entrepreneur.

These other departments that previously could not digest the complexity of the data presented (or had no data to view at all) can now contribute to the conversation more effectively and collaborate in milestone reviews with more productive dialogues.Although portfolios often contain seemingly unrelated projects with vastly different regimes there is still value in comparing like for like benchmarking metrics to recognise the key drivers and contributing factors influencing the success stages of each project. The more general project by project comparisons that are analysed the more portfolio managers are able to recognise the leaders and influencing factors that can drive success.By providing this level of detail we start to reduce cognitive bias that is often built up on â€˜popular projectsâ€™ and start to rely more on the empirical foundations of value and more accurately forecast our objectives.A quality project management tool will reduce data entry errors which frees up time for project managers to conduct more confident reviews on each specific project and understand how the ranking of the portfolio compares from period to period.Forecast rollups should be automatic and not rely on stand alone spreadsheets- this wastes time and decreases the ability to quickly make decisions. For tactical mastery forecasts must be frequent and in real time.Company wide mechanisms to flag projects that do not conform to set data ranges can be implemented with a quality project management cost analysis system to also allow comparisons to historical data and ongoing review processes that encompass every single project in the system no matter how large or small.The discipline that can be enforced is far reaching and can add precious % points of total portfolio management returns and improve overall portfolio management while also enhancing the ability to allocate more capital to buckets of opportunity that may previously have not been able to be engaged.By implementing a smarter project management cost control system a significant shift in fact based decisions can be attained and overall project and portfolio NPV improvements can occur.----Technology enthusiast with an entrepreneurial background in education and software technology.The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Scott H.

The premise of this article was that the technology required to reinvent an industry worked and was cheap to deploy on a global scale.This trend has unfolded in industries such as transportation (Uber), Finance (Monzo, Funding Circle & TransferWise) and Food (Deliveroo).Retail has also been transformed but most of the innovation has happened online. This has led retail e-commerce sales to be projected to be just over 25% of retail sales by 2021 (https://www.emarketer.com/Report/UK-Retail-Ecommerce-eMarketers-Updated-Estimates-Forecast-20162021/2002188).E-commerce has grown because online retail provides you with a personalized shopping experience, anywhere you are and at any time. This begs the question with all of the innovation going into online stores why are most sales still projected to happen offline? I believe this is because shopping online:- Makes you delay gratification: You cannot use what you have purchased immediately. You have to wait for it to be delivered. This usually takes at least a day. In some cases, it takes weeks. Ask yourself why would People queue for hours outside Apple stores to get the latest iPhone instead of ordering online? This is because the feeling of having it immediately and sometimes before everyone else is worth it to them- Makes it difficult to use your senses: Ever seen someone in a grocery store pick up a pack of chicken? look at it, drop it and then pick up another. What they are doing is assessing the quality using their sense of sight. This also happens when people go shopping for clothes, they touch the clothes to sense how it feels, they try on different sizes to see how it fits and more importantly how it makes them feel. This leads them to an informed decision about their purchase.The reasons stated above make me think that the emerging tech trends across retail, are the ones that will transform the offline shopping experience and put it on par with the online shopping experience. This will create a seamless omnichannel shopping experience the blends the benefits of shopping online and offline together. Thus, concluding the transformation of the entire retail industry as it would have been eaten by softwareHere are my 5 emerging tech trends that will affect retailI initially termed this section â€˜Location-based marketingâ€™. Then I realised most â€˜LBMâ€™ efforts are based on attracting consumers to shops to purchase in item. This is usually done by sending an alert to their phone, posting flyers in the window of shops or posting boards outside the shop. The common theme is that retailer starts the conversation and communication is one-too-many. In the future, I believe consumers and brick and mortar retailers will be able to communicate with each other in real-time. This will be enabled by the smartphone which has a market penetration of 85% in the UK. In an â€˜LBCâ€™ world communication takes the form of:1) Retailer to Consumer: This happens when retailers want to attract shoppers to their stores. For example, uploading their deals for consumers nearby to see.2) Consumer to Retailer: This happens when consumers want information about products in a store. For example, to inquire about whether a business has an item they want in-stock. This form of communication gives businesses more opportunities to build stronger relationships with shoppers.3) Consumer to Consumer: This happens when shoppers in an area are sharing information about a business. For example, when a shopper sees a deal, they think is great. They can choose to share with their friends in the area.QR codes were first designed in 1994 by the Japanese automotive industry. QR codes give retailers the opportunity to deliver an omnichannel experience at their brick and mortar shops. They can be used to give consumers the ability to â€˜Log Inâ€™ to brick and mortar shops. Once a consumer has â€˜logged inâ€™ to a shop they can either browse the aisles to see the products or view them on their phone. Consumers can also use their phones to find out more information about the products e.g. nutritional information, product locationLong queues cost retailers up to Â£12 billion in the UK per year (https://www.retailtimes.co.uk/long-queues-cost-uk-retailers-up-to-12-billion-per-year/). This is a lot of lost money for a low-margin industry. Self-service mobile apps could be the answer. A mobile app that allows consumers to simply scan the barcode of their preferred item and pay for it without queueing up. Self-service mobile apps will just not be about payments, but it would also enable self-service discovery in store. Consumers can use the app to navigate the stores as well as get more information about the products in a store. Consumers can also use these apps to claim their loyalty pointsThis is a piece of technology that can greatly enhance the customer experience for shoppers. Retailers can use augmented reality to help shoppers navigate their stores to find the productsâ€™ they need. AR can also be used to create delightful animations that brighten a shoppers day. For example, you could have shoppers come into the store, place their orders and then wait by watching AR animations.Computer vision is technology that could either help retail staff do their job better or lead to widespread job loss. I believe this is because the applications of computer vision in retail could range from alerting store assistants about which aisles are running out of items, so they can retrieve new stock. This stops retailers from losing sales. They can also be used to help retailers spot potential shoplifters by identifying people who are not entering all their items at self-service machines and alerting the staff. I consider these to be positive applications. The negative applications could end up eliminating jobs as the use of computer vision for in-store payments e.g. Amazon Go becomes widespread----I enjoy building products that makes peoples lives betterEfe Imoloame--Efe Imoloame--Efe Imoloame--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Stephen Butts #John316inProduct Coalition--5Matt ChapmaninTowards Data Science--21Guodong (Troy) ZhaoinBootcamp--31Bart KrawczykinProduct Coalition--9J.A.

Utilities have changed the business models entirely by embracing cloud solutions. Cloud technology offers versatility with scalable solutions, exceptional computation power, virtually limitless data access, and potential cost savings, helping utilities in their operations. The technology has the potential to enhance business performance in many ways beyond cost mitigation. With cloud technology, utilities can experiment and improve solutions without significant outlays of money, hence providing flexibility and agility with minimum investment. It also provides transparency and real-time reporting, enabling valuable support to contract, joint enterprise, and partnership arrangements. Cloud technology is playing a significant role in utilities as it empowers businesses to deliver solutions and services at a rapid pace with efficiency. There are several reasons why utilities should move towards the cloud.â€¢ AffordabilityMoving to cloud technology saves utility businesses significant hardware and software purchasing costs. Companies that are expanding at a rapid pace have realized the pain of increased expenses, as new hardware and software purchases can be expensive. Cloud technology reduces these issues as resources can be obtained faster and easily, passing the cost of fixing or replacing equipment to the vendors.â€¢ Ensuring Security and ReliabilityCloud technology has transformed multiple businesses at a revolutionary rate with new compliances and modifications. The advent of cloud technology has enabled new workforce mobility. It has allowed flexibility for employees to work anywhere using any device. Moving to cloud services is the best and most cost-efficient means to modernize a business. It ensures that identification, infrastructure, data, and devices are secure from any malicious attack. Suspicious devices are blocked automatically, ensuring business productivity, allowing remote management of services.â€¢ EfficiencyCloud technology scales with businesses, spinning up new servers in minutes. It is easy to balance down by using virtual machines. The organizationâ€™s digital footprint increases in real-time, creating more excellent business efficiencies. Cloud technology enables utility businesses to adapt to market conditions by featuring flexibility. Apart from adapting to external situations, this virtual solution also facilitates quick responses to internal requirements. If user demand increases, cloud services can be advanced to meet the demand and then be easily modified as demand falls. This eliminates the problem of IT systems overload or over-provisioning.The adoption of cloud technology has drastically increased with utilities facing increased disruption in todayâ€™s age. It has enabled utilities with the potential to learn from new data insights while developing more responsive outcomes and programs, and manage infrastructure more flexibly and efficiently. Cloud technology can provide a competitive edge to an industry where business models are changing. Increasing security, cloud technology has upgraded the features while monitoring threats continually, empowering utilities to a great extent.5 Reason Why Utilities Are Switching To The CloudThe utility industry is on the brink of modernization. The phase of transformation is at its peak as companies in the sector look to optimize production and delivery with the help of the technology-backed solution. Field services now present the best opportunities for utilities to enable rapid development in power production, reliability, maintenance, and controls. When the capabilities of cloud computing are added to field service, utility firms are in the best possible positions to undertake targeted development. By instilling superior features and equipping firms with the most advanced of tools, cloud-based field services are helping enhance profitability and customer satisfaction to no end. Some of the challenges that the power production units and plants currently face include legacy infrastructure issues, altered consumption patterns, growing demands, and compliance management. Cloud computing can help utility firms in numerous ways, some of which are mentioned below.â€¢ Optimized IT InfrastructurePower production and distribution facilities are massive and complicated. As the industry transforms into digital models, the requirement of IT infrastructure is also growing complex by the day. Companies have to deploy a lot of resources in upgrading legacy infrastructure to accommodate IT capabilities. From acquiring hardware to recruiting the appropriate skill-sets, firms have to do it all. Cloud can help utilities get lean by reducing dependence on on-premise IT. The overhead costs of proprietary infrastructure can be eliminated to a considerable extent. The cloud-based field services provide all the tools and expertise that the firms need in a flexible and scalable manner.â€¢ From Capital to OperationalField services which are deployed from the clouds have the added advantage of helping the utility firms make a transformation from capital expenditure to operational expenditure. Capital expenditure involves a lot of investment in developing fixed assets and thus, is heavy. On the other hand, operational expenditure is an ongoing cost that does not burn a hole in a companyâ€™s pocket. Power production companies can ease spending by opting for as-a-service products offered by several providers. These solutions are customizable so that companies can add capabilities and scale up any time they find the necessity to do so. From storage to processing to data analytics, everything becomes much more convenient on a cloud-based platform.â€¢ The Speed FactorAs data analytics gains importance, utility firms are also looking for opportunities to imbibe them. Through data analytics, companies can study trends and make intelligent business decisions. However, the process of analytics can prove to be very intensive and thus slow when carried out through legacy systems. When the field services that enable data analytics are from cloud platforms, there are fewer lags. Vast amounts of information can be processed rapidly to help arrive at recommendations that drive up operational efficiencies at production plants and improvise distribution patterns.â€¢ Accessibility and AffordabilityThe potential of software solutions and field services are substantial. However, the limitations of accessibility cast a shadow on them. With the cloud, the field services grow much more potent as collaborations, communications, and information exchange become seamless. Every system and employee can gain access to centralized solutions and data when they are stored in the cloud. Coordinating various parallel workflows in the dynamic energy production units becomes significantly simpler with the real-time abilities that cloud technologies bring.â€¢ Resolving ReliabilityUtility companies are expected to provide reliable services. However, it is not always possible to prevent breakdowns and outages. Field services are deploying advanced technological tools to detect and fix issues in real-time with minimum efforts. Such an approach minimizes wastage and disruptions. Cloud computing enables the field services to handle crucial situations better by improving the reaction time. By providing constant monitoring, maintenance practices also change from reactive to proactive.Thus, innovative field services, when combined with cloud technology, make for the best solutions in the utility sector.Source â€” Utilities Tech Outlook----Johnson Thomas--Johnson Thomas--1Johnson Thomas--Johnson Thomas--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Scott H.

So, for them to achieve this desired performance, L&D teams have to design engaging, precise and easy to apply e-course.Here are a few tips that can help you in designing a performance-based e-learning course.Well-prepared content plays a crucial role along with perfect e-learning design in boosting employee performance.First of all, you need to be clear about what your content aims at achieving. Need analysis and task analysis would help you in this regard.Need analysis would help you determine if your e-learning course is relevant and required. Conducting this analysis might seem strenuous, but itâ€™s an easy process.So, getting this analysis right can help you in designing a performance-based e-learning course. Below are the practical steps for conducting an e-learning need-analysis:The first thing to consider when conducting a need analysis is to determine the desired level of employeesâ€™ performance. The desired performance level usually gets decided by the stakeholders employing your service.But it doesnâ€™t have to end there as you can also make a further search on the topic to know the best performance.Knowing the desired level of employee performance will give you an insight into how you can design a performance-based e-learning course.This second step is important to determine the performance gap. Most employees find themselves taking e-learning courses for one reason or another.But whatever the reason, the goal is to achieve a boost in their performance. You can determine the current level of performance in many ways depending on how you choose to do it.One way to check for employee performance is through 180-degree or 360-degree feedback. Another way is by checking the number of sales or units produced.Having determined both the current and desired level of performance, you can identify with ease, the cause of the performance gap.The performance gap may be due to a lack of motivation towards work which does need that you leverage intrinsic motivation into your e-learning course.Task analysis is good to determine what employees need to perform a specific task. The task analysis is an analytical process of determining how a companyâ€™s task reaches completion.With this analysis, you can be sure that your course performance goal relates directly to the employeeâ€™s task. The task analysis will also help you to get the entire scope of what youâ€™re able to teach.There are 3 steps involved in carrying out e-learning task-analysis:Recognizing the primary procedure is the first step to conducting an e-learning task analysis.However, when trying to recognize the employeeâ€™s primary procedure, be sure to make it less complex. Thatâ€™s to avoid carrying out e-learning task analysis on the complex procedure.For instance, you want to conduct a task analysis of vegetable oil refining. Conducting a task analysis on oil refining might be too complex.Thatâ€™s because there are several procedures/processes involved when it comes to refining vegetable oil.Having recognized your primary procedure, what is next is to identify and make a list of the employeeâ€™s main tasks.These will help you when youâ€™re trying to design your e-learning course.Itâ€™s important to breakdown your main tasks into subtasks. By doing so, you can find it easy to give step-by-step explanations on what your learners need to know.Another way to boost employee performance is to design repetitive e-learning courses. Itâ€™s often said that practice makes perfect, so a repetitive course can help employees to master new skills.So, while trying to create new e-learning courses for employees, itâ€™s advisable that you blend it up and make it more interesting.Another important tip to consider is to avoid making your e-learning course a one-time event. For you to achieve a high-performance rate, itâ€™s best you design your course as a process.For instance, an L&D program that trains employees on â€œanalyzing and visualizing data with Excelâ€ might start by setting up a lab environment.Data set and examples usage can, then, follow, which will give the employee insight into what theyâ€™re about to learn.But it shouldnâ€™t end there; make the course to be more interactive to avoid getting them bored.Employees should receive adequate training and then get assigned to practice what they learn through live practice at work. Learning is a process, not a one-time event.So, the L&D team should make a habit of designing a long-term course to boost employee performance. L&D team can also consistently share articles and videos to remind employees or learner to apply their new skills at work.If you have any specific queries, please, leave a comment below.----Naveen is the chief executive officer at Wizcabin.

Robert De Niroâ€™s Travis Bickle stares intensely at himself in the mirror: â€œYou talkinâ€™ to me?â€ A gun clicks into action from under his sleeve. His arm shoots up. To anyone watching, itâ€™s instinct: Travis is capable of murder.Itâ€™s an iconic image in cinematic history. That violent look that says it all. Those dilated pupils. That menacing stare. Our ability to understand Travisâ€™ core by a single look is perhaps partly due to De Niroâ€™s acting chops, but also emanates from something way more powerful. In an instant in 1976 on the set of Marty Scorseseâ€™s, Taxi Driver, Robert De Niro demonstrated to the world the sheer power of the human gaze. Something so powerful that, today, itâ€™s a key evolutionary piece of the next generation of AI assistants.In order to evolve towards common sense understanding, AI assistants of the future must have eyes. The power of sight is obvious: with eyes, your assistant will be able to actually see you and physically help you based on what it discerns are your needs determined by its view of your displayed emotions, facial expressions, and physical surroundings. Less obvious, though, is the emotional connection youâ€™ll forge with your seeing AI assistant. Eyes, you see, donâ€™t just power vision, they allow for us to understand and connect with each other on an intuitive level. This â€œconnectionâ€ powered by gaze is something we often donâ€™t realize we hunger for until itâ€™s gone.Did you know that exactly three seconds is the ideal time humans prefer to be held in someoneâ€™s direct gaze? Nine seconds and youâ€™re considered a potential psychopath. Itâ€™s a fine line that we humans tread when making crucial, everyday judgments based on the seemingly intangible metric we call gaze. It also has an air of art rather than science. For example, we rate peopleâ€™s personalities and even make hiring decisions based on what we perceive when fellow humans stare back at us. Is it unfair not to hire someone because they didnâ€™t make eye contact? Did you get a â€œbad feelingâ€ when looking into someoneâ€™s eyes? Put it this way: if Travis Bickle stepped into your office for a job interview, would you look at that man and say, â€œyeah, I want him talking to customersâ€? No! Youâ€™d nod politely and thank him for his time. It may seem impulsive â€” an art, if you will â€” but there are actual chemical changes that occur when we gaze at fellow humans that affect how we feel about them. In these gazing moments, the human brain literally grapples with the fact that it is both judging and being judged by the same being. Some studies even suggest that pupil dilation in anotherâ€™s gaze affects trust!Hereâ€™s the catch: While visual connection and contact seem so natural to us, we often donâ€™t notice it in the moment, unless, of course, weâ€™ve been practicing our mindfulness meditation techniques! Barring that, however, we use this connection to make judgments about people without even knowing it. In an amazing biological instance, itâ€™s been shown that those who make eye contact experience a process called self-other merging where they see less of a difference between themselves and the person theyâ€™re staring at. When self-merging occurs, your empathy for the other person literally grows as you begin to see your needs as their needs. In short, eye contact crucially helps build trust and create lasting relationships.Gaze is such a natural if invisible aspect of human biology that we both crave it and forget about it simultaneously. It makes sense, then, that product designers forgot about this quintessentially human trait when they designed the first AI assistants. If gaze is so important to how we navigate our relationships with our fellow humans, why should our relationship with tech be any different? Itâ€™s about time that the tech world caught up.With our ability to quantify gaze, tech firms are finally harnessing the power of the eye to make AI avatars and assistants more humanlike. Imagine interacting with an assistant that relates to your problems, gives you sage advice, and acts as a sounding board and mentor. Imagine a machine that not only understands that youâ€™re sad, but knows the cause of your pain and uses itâ€™s engineered empathy to soothe you and help solve your problem.What does this mean from a business perspective? As we increasingly rely on tech as a tool to receive and communicate information, there are huge amounts of growth possible for the AI assistant market. It also shows that humans place huge amounts of unseen value on the ability to emotionally connect with a product. AI assistants can seize on that. It also has huge tech implications:In the very near future, we will have task-specific AIs that will be able to beat the Turing Test. Will they be able to talk to you about any subject that enters your mind? No. But youâ€™ll be able to interact with them seamlessly about specific topics. For example one of the skills TwentyBNâ€™s Millie avatar has is trendy style advice. She can proactively engage customers, invite them into delightful interactions, analyze their style and recommend cool outfits they could buy in-store as a best friend would. Thatâ€™s just one of the infinite things AI assistants will be able to do when empowered with eyes.Plus, with eyes, they wonâ€™t have to ask if â€œyou talkinâ€™ to me?â€ Theyâ€™ll know.----twentybnDavid Greenbergintwentybn--Raghav Goyalintwentybn--1Nahua Kangintwentybn--Nahua Kangintwentybn--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Scott H.

 TCP portfolio insights and DD. All income derived from the external consumption of DD will go to the TCPâ€™s master contract (think of it like a pot), to be divided equitably amongst all Aspirants and Token-Holders of that TCP at the end of the fund lifecycle.Upon the liquidation of a TCP, or when a typical Token Holder opts out of a given TCP, they convert their L2 tokens back into L1 tokens (selling them back and therefore burning them into the master contract of that TCP). At this point, they may choose to invest in one of the other TCPâ€™s, or they may trigger the smart contract holding their collateralized Dai stable coin.Influencer investors (influencer Token-Holders) are compensated for their time, efforts, and expertise. Therefore, they maintain the right to take their 20% of the total profit of that TCP. TCVC as a platform, for building the architecture that enables this new investment paradigm of decentralization, will take 5% of all L2 protocol tokens of that TCP.Another option we contemplate is that tokens generated from consumption of DD will be given on a commensurate basis to how many service consumers the TCP can sell their tokens to. This allows the TCP to invest in utility tokens and achieve a profit without choking the networks of those utility Candidates.Constant promotion from all parties in the TCP is necessary to fulfill the value proposition of the TCP. Companies will want to get investment from any one (or multiple) TCPâ€™s to gain access to an army of dedicated cheerleaders.Therefore

My mother country Bangladesh for example relies heavily on the export of labor. Basically many young men and more and more women are going abroad to work on various projects providing manual labor. These people mostly send money back home as they are a large hope of their families (Using cultural context here most families arenâ€™t just husband and wife, but mom, dad, siblings and sometimes even grand parents) and this is true in most of Southeast Asia.In my father land, the United States, there are many (leaving politics aside) who migrate from South America providing labor, for example on short term lease in farm lands. How will this automation technological shift effect these working class families? And how will these countries cope with the change when many are jobless. A bit scary to think about if we look at the fuller picture, global peace and stability. I thoroughly believe whether a Silicon Valley startup (which I am a part of today) or a working class family in Bangladesh, economics plays a crucial role on whom the pressure will fall upon if strategic initiatives are not taken beforehand, whether at the macro or micro level.There is some good news, there are many discussions on-going now on private media channels (in Bangladesh), especially among business shows on how to diversify risks and push the country forward as the country will soon shift towards the middle income index. However, its crucial for any third world country in its desire to move to the second world category, to emphasize on thoughtful planning that is organic, in keeping with cultural context.----Lifetime traveler, NYC native, currently Silicon Valley.

In the early 1970s, a few young, tech-savvy rabbinical students developed a telephone system enabling Chassidim from around the world to tune into the Rebbeâ€™s weekday farbrengens live. The pilot project of three phone lines blossomed into WLCC; an elaborate system connecting dozens of locations and thousands of individuals to the events transpiring at Chabad HQ. (Read more about that Chassidic tech startup here.)In the famous passage of Shema Yisrael that is recited twice daily, Moses instructs the Israelites (Deuteronomy 6:6): â€œThese words which I command you today shall be upon your hearts.â€ Although we received the Torah and the Mitzvot at Sinai 3,330 years, we must view them as brand new â€” received today.This is one of the most powerful elements of the Rebbeâ€™s teachings. Every message is permeated with the awareness that each passage of the Torah is timeless, the smallest details of Jewish law are consequential and even the simplest stories are profoundly relevant. The Rebbe transmitted this refreshing approach to Judaism at the farbrengens, thus initiating a revolution in Jewish life, by invigorating a generation of survivors and educating future generations of Jewish leaders.In addition to the content of the message providing such spiritual energy, the Rebbeâ€™s unique style of delivery truly energized the listeners. The clarity, passion and urgency inspired thousands to action. This is why WLCC was so important. Reading a transcript does not compare to hearing it directly from the source.When my parents moved to El Paso to establish a Chabad presence, their first purchase was a phone line by WLCC. (In the bottom right corner of the above photo, you will notice the switch marked E.PSO). This was their lifeline to the refreshing inspiration of the Rebbeâ€™s teachings and instructions.Today, I receive this very same inspiration from the recordings of those farbrengens. In addition to learning Torah from printed books, the Rebbeâ€™s voice and delivery brings it all together and keeps it fresh. The recordings of these farbrengens so easily accessible on a mobile app is my spiritual lifeline today, as the WLCC phone line was for my parents, years ago.Although the Rebbeâ€™s public talks were in Yiddish, JEM regularly publishes videos of these talks with subtitles in numerous languages. I invite you to partake in this valuable treasure.

So many fascinating topics and speakers. Whilst this conference focused on Manchester, UK, itâ€™s a snapshot of technology and the big issues we are facing here will likely resonate across the globe.So my three big takeaways from the trailblazing tech conference were:In the UK there is a new tech job created every 40 minutes, but these are not all being filled. By 2020 there are estimated to be 800,000 unfilled technical roles in the UK.Cha ching! A good thing for anyone working in technology in the UK. It surely means increases in pay, guaranteed work, the choice of the most interesting jobs, better perks and working hours as businesses scramble to retain and attract the brightest talent.What could this mean for our industry in general? Could this be the demise of businesses not able to entice the talent to bring their plans to life?This is exciting for me, as a techie, but as a manager it adds constraints and challenge. I believe constraints encourage innovation and are great for encouraging businesses to evolve. An evolving business is an interesting place to be.If the basic principles of supply and demand apply, the cost of technical people will go up, offering bigger salaries to attract the best talent. Luckily, whilst salary is always an important consideration, itâ€™s not always the most important thing people are looking for. In my experience, working environment, people, challenging and interesting work, flexibility and true (and good) corporate values are all as highly valued, if not more so, than a big salary.If salaries were to sky rocket many technical projects may not be viable for a business to undertake. Business will undoubtedly look for the cheapest alternative to local talent. This could be to look abroad for their technical teams. Looking to other countries to off shore at present isnâ€™t massively cheaper than getting locally based people. This is compounded by the additional management cost, risk to quality and lack of visibility and control. This in itself creates more jobs even as some are off shored.We live in an ever changing world. Off shoring may not be the answer in all cases and is certainly not the creative answer to the problems that may lay ahead. One thing is for certain, there will be changes in the ways we work and this will benefit the people in the industry greatly.Technology is in every aspect of our life. The human race, it seems, are happy to try anything. It does not always work. Google Glass, for example, seemed short lived and personally for me, way too muchâ€” we were still willing to try it though! But other times it does, Amazonâ€™s Echo Dot was its top selling product for three years in a row.Technology enables us to improve every aspect of our lives, but we donâ€™t always trust it. I, for example, set an alarm every night on my phone, even though I could just set it to come on every morning (I didnâ€™t even realise I did this until Garry Prior at The Hut Group mentioned he had the same problem in his keynote). Wow, Iâ€™m a â€œtechnology personâ€, but it appears I donâ€™t fully embrace and trust it! So we both consciously and sub-consciously chose not to trust the tech in our life. So human interaction is seems could be the limiting factor in complete automation and systematisation (which is good because we all know what happened when Skynet took over!).I work in the financial services sector and we are always looking for ways to improve our service and offering through technology. My peers and I talk about the merits of blockchain and voice technology. Voice is big and has had significant impact on Amazonâ€™s sales. But how do you do this for banking or to interact with your accountant?In the mid 1700s the industrial revolution changed the way people worked using new manufacturing processes. The cotton industry, which was at the forefront of technology at the time, saw people replaced by machines.We are in the middle of â€œIndustry 4.0â€ (the fourth industrial revolution), technology is taking over, robotics, new advanced manufacturing material graphene and health systems are changing ways we work and live. There are predictions of automation of many industries from law to taxi services.There is a fear that this will put people out of work. It may do so, but it will also give rise to new opportunities. Take a production line worker, for example a person constructs cardboard boxes on a conveyor belt. We now have technology that can do this pretty mundane task. Some businesses, like Siemens, have a commitment that robots will not replace people, but enable that person to move onto a better, more interesting role. By effectively delegating mundane tasks to robots and systems of automation, we can better utilise our existing workforce to add value to our organisations.----Code GymI implement high value technology roadmaps and strategies for businesses that care about their impact on the world.James AlcockinCode Gym--James AlcockinCode Gym--James AlcockinCode Gym--James AlcockinNavigate--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Alex Mathers--220HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

A century later, a resurgence of technology-enabled ride-hailing, ridesharing, micromobility and carsharing businesses are disrupting more traditional transportation. The popularity of on-demand mobility suggests a bright future for the industry, but few of these businesses are reliably profitable today.Working feverishly in search of profit and customer retention, and fighting against evolving competitors and regulations, these companies are quickly iterating their business models. Long-term success is far from guaranteed, but many of the ingredients (phone-hailing, cashless transactions, mapping, vehicle tracking, time/cost prediction) are identifiable as necessary components in todayâ€™s primordial soup of on-demand mobility.Even as these underlying technologies remain the same, we expect business models to continue evolving, and the companies leading today may not be the ones that endure. Part of this uncertainty arises because todayâ€™s on-demand mobility businesses have flourished under favorable market conditions that may not last:This environment has allowed rapid market entry by numerous mobility innovators and followers. However, as on-demand mobility matures, investors will focus more on the financial performance of these companies. Measurable performance indicators such as cost per ride, customer lifetime value, customer acquisition and retention, driver acquisition and retention, and active user growth are now scrutinized more than ever before. On-demand mobility services companies are quickly realizing that they will need to reduce the cost per ride and increase the revenue per ride and each customerâ€™s lifetime value. These companies are already taking steps to curtail their marketing costs and attempt to improve profitability by increasing fares, and decreasing driver payments.Adjusting customer fares and driver payments is a delicate balancing act. First of all, willingness to pay for a ride and willingness to work may be negatively correlated (how much would you pay for someone to drive you on New Yearâ€™s Eve? Or how much would someone have to pay you to drive them?) While increasing the effective â€œcommissionâ€ rate leads to better profitability, lower payments to drivers lead to dissatisfaction and attrition. Driver attrition leads to service quality deterioration, which leads to customer attrition. Customer attrition leads to lower effective driver income, leading to driver attrition. These mutually reinforcing effects mean that any market instability, left unchecked, could lead to a rapid downward spiral in use of the service.In order to create on-demand mobility services businesses with long-term profitability, companies must increase what customers are willing to pay for each service and each customerâ€™s â€œshare of wallet,â€ and/or reduce the cost of providing each service. There are at least two ways to increase revenue and four ways to reduce costs. In particular, revenues can be increased by providing:Costs can be reduced by:In California, Assembly Bill 5 (and here) has redefined employees in a way that may force ride-hailing and goods delivery companies to reclassify workers as employees. Uber and Lyft have already indicated their intention to challenge such reclassification, representative groups of workers have brought at least one lawsuit, and California Governor Gavin Newsom indicated his inclination to negotiate. It may take years before the nature of this type of work is fully defined.Reclassification of drivers will certainly change the relationship between ride-hailing/ridesharing companies and the people providing their service, but itâ€™s not a death knell. A ride-hailing model based on purpose-built, efficient, cheap-to-operate vehicles operating at a scale large enough to pool large numbers of passengers could allow driver pay to increase while vehicle operational costs decrease, and revenue from denser passenger demand increases revenue.Mobility services companies are not facing the same dilemmas as automakers, but in some ways, the experimentation in on demand mobility presents some of the same risks as those facing automakers we described in â€œThe Automotive Industry at a Crossroads.â€ The ingredients for multimodal on-demand mobility services including technology and business models are all there.The challenge these companies will need to address revolves around using these ingredients to develop scalable and enduring businesses in order to provide the services their customers demand and the financial returns their investors expect. Changing the cost and revenue structure may require vast investment in the short run, but might actually result in a more optimal long-term mobility ecosystem, allowing the industry to fully emerge from the primordial soup.----The HiveThe Hive is a venture fund & co-creation studio based in Palo Alto, CA to co-create startups focused on AI powered applications in the enterprise.The HiveinThe Hive--The HiveinThe Hive--1The HiveinThe Hive--1The HiveinThe Hive--Unbecoming--764The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

There is the standard Model B (85.6 x 56.6mm) with a full complement of I/O connectors. If you are willing to give up some features, you can get the squarish A+ model (65 x 56mm), the Compute Module form factor (67.6 x 30mm), or even the ultra-compact Pi Zero (30 x 65mm).What do you do if you want to implement a custom Raspberry Pi design? Can something smaller than the Pi Zero be made? The first problem you run into is that the Broadcom SoC is not available to the mass market. That reason alone is why most people would give up on the idea of a custom Raspberry Pi. However, despite not being able to acquire the chips, the team at ArduCam came up with a solution. The result is a 3B+ system-on-module (SoM) measuring only 40 x 25mm or 80% smaller than a traditional Pi!At first, you might think this board is a Raspberry Pi clone. Since the SoC used on the Pi is not available for others to implement into a custom design, ArduCam is clear they do not plan to sell this as a product. Instead, they explain youâ€™ll need to purchase a Raspberry Pi module and de-solder the SoC. From there, youâ€™ll be able to attach it to the smaller board. (Alternatively, they offer services to do that part for you, provided, you provide the Pi.)Make sure you check out the demo video. It shows how they have attached the SoM to a carrier board. Using their cameras, they demo a dual camera setup after the Pi successfully boots.----2Fan of making things that beep, blink, and fly. Follow as @baldengineer.

Technological advancements are happening and taking place in this world at some really fast pace. Everyday some or the other new technology is coming to the fore on some vertical or the other. The field of technology has indeed become one such area. An area where development and progress have been just in a word absolutely phenomenal and massive. But if one is to ask amongst the diversified and manifolds of advantages & benefits that technology provides humans with, what is it that really stands out, then it has just got to be the way and manner in which it binds people together and creates a sense of unity amongst them. Really, there is no denying of the fact that technology is at its very best when it brings people together.There are many ways how technology brings people together. The ways can be broadly classified into two- I) direct ways and II) indirect ways. First, getting into direct ways of how technology aids in bringing people together. Well, it is very simple. Suppose a group of people is working together to give fruit to an idea of working on a project. On such occasions, a bond is forming which will definitely be a unifying one. It helps and reflects in the eventual outcome of the endeavor as well. Thus, group activity is facilitating big time in this case and it vividly shows too. The different ideas, hard work, and combination of ideas that go into the making of a new technology speak as much of the new technological discovery or invention as much as of the people and brains behind it whose combined effort made it possible.Now, coming to the indirect ways of how technology influences people in bringing them together. This concept is very easy to understand too. The technology once created is then used by millions of people worldwide in their daily lives. Thus, a sense of unity of sorts is generated amongst the people using the technology. Therefore, technology can really have a mammoth impact on the lives of people not only by their sheer presence and considering their utility in human lives but also due to the fact that how it helps to make people come close to one another.The best part of technology, hence, is not always necessarily the benefits it brings to peopleâ€™s life nor the way it eases oneâ€™s life from various aspects just by the dint or virtue of its presence but definitely owing to its uncanny ability or rather knack in pulling people together. With technology really looking to set further new standards and all set to reach some more eloquent heights it is only fair to assume and predict if not be certain of that technology would further facilitate and continue to knit people closer. Technology expected to rule the roost in the years to come, this much is a given one would feel, hope and assume.----StarcompStar Comp--Star CompinStarcomp--Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--268The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--341Unbecoming--764Alex Mathers--217Bryan YeinBetter Humans--638Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--165HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

This design process starts with the selection of colors, icons, and arrangement of menus, additional information, etc. Usually to create a platform interface, also some special methods are needed. This is done because the appearance and performance of a platform can describe the quality and condition of the company. Display quality and educative platfrom certainly designed and designed by a number of teams of experts working on the company. Of course the lay community will also think, that the company is very concerned about the quality of the company starting from small things in detail. Therefore, a good quality design platform must also be balanced with the quality of the companyâ€™s services that can be implemented in real terms.Therefore Drife as a cryptocurrency platform that provides K services in the field of transportation, also strives to always improve the quality of platform design using the UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) methods. Both of these methods are indeed very familiar in the process of making attractive platform designs. The UI method is commonly referred to as the face-to-face method. Which is the first time a user sees a platform. The first thing that is assessed is the appearance of the platform, for example an assessment of the color selection that is not striking. The color selection technique basically is a form of appearance assessment that is very dominating. Because color will symbolize the seriousness of the companyâ€™s vision and mission. We take a direct example of the color selection techniques available on the Drife platform. Black is selected as the color displayed on the main page. Then on the next page the patterned white and black alternately begin to dominate. While the bottom part is dominated by blue. This method of color collaboration is done so that prospective users do not feel bored in conducting information searches.In the second stage, after the user gets his first impression from the display design platform. Users will see whether the design of the platform is supported by the provision of communicative information. Communicative referred to here is information presented in formal language and easily understood by ordinary people. We know that Drife productivity activities can only work with the start of a relationship of interaction between the driver and customer service users.Unlike the case with cryptocurency platforms that are engaged in investment, which will present language terms that are not necessarily understood by users. But to be able to join, these users are required to immediately understand all kinds of information presented. This is inversely proportional to Drife who must first understand user needs. The initial language used will be adjusted to the marketing target of the platform.From this we can understand, that most of the main Drife target markets will be lay people who do not have much experience in currency trading activities. It is natural that they are not too familiar to hear terms in the digital economy and computerization.Therefore all information presented must be arranged professionally. For example on the initial page of the platform Drife displays the main purpose and all kinds of features that have been arranged in the upper right corner. On the next page it is followed by information on various components of technology, understanding and the main reasons for using Drife as a means of transportation, complete information about tokenisasi, methods of payment, road maps, complete information about the founder and team, and others. In plain view, we can assess that the display design of the Drife platform can be categorized as a professional and educational platform.This UI and UX method can be implemented properly. If at the beginning of the design process, the teams pay attention to several important components. These important components include usable, consistent, and subjection.From the two design methods and the three components above. Design on the Drife platform can be said as a platform design that has met standardization. Before the development of the internet world, at the initial stage we always assessed the quality of the company from the building being built. Unlike the case with the current digital era, where the development of a platform is very important. Because it can be accessed in a more global scope. Therefore, it is desirable for all platforms to be able to balance the quality of design and service quality.Website | Telegram| Twitter | Whitepaper----Edwar ronal--Edwar ronal--Edwar ronal--Edwar ronal--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alex Mathers--220Unbecoming--764Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Christina SainUX Planet--64HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Now we push forward the boundaries of market intelligence by re-inventing ourselves and announcing the release of our new v.3 platform.In physics, we consider the big bang as the near-magical event that created the universe â€” before that nothing was supposed to exist. Our v.3 platform is no big bang as our users and clients will keep access to the services they use, but they will get even much more â€” lots of new features that did not exist before and a significant upgrade of existing ones! You can consider it as a massive spring cleaning operation.We have launched this project back in Q3 2018, triggered by two significant events. First, we raised a substantial round of funding that was intended from the start to upgrade our infrastructure. Second, Google announced a substantial change in its API policy, which was a U-Turn to its historical 3rd party developers friendliness policy. Apart from closing its (long non-performing) Google+ service, Google announced it would close its Gmail API to market intelligence companies and more generally to most 3rd party developers. As our platform was heavily relying on Gmail API to retrieve our raw material (newsletter and commercial emails from the mailboxes of our users), we naturally decided to accelerate the transformation of our platform, as the (not so clear) deadline was scheduled for this spring.Our new platform integrates more closely the three pillars that create our unique positioning to realize our vision, that information empowers people. Information empowers consumers to make better decisions through data contained in their mailboxes, thanks to Cleanfox. Information empowers digital professionals to make better business decisions through a 360Â° view of what is happening on their market, thanks to Foxwatch. And everything is powered by Foxbrain, our unique technology to structure, enrich and make sense of the extraordinary source of information we capture (actual consumption traces of billions of products from millions of consumers, encapsulated in the transaction confirmations sent by emails).Our new platform builds on what we achieved so far, to push one step further at each stage of the data acquisition and transformation process.We have big plans for Cleanfox â€” empowering consumers with their own data to change their digital habits for their own good (e.g., altering their consumption for budgeting purposes) or for the greater good (e.g., reducing their carbon footprint).To realize this ambition (in a context where Gmail API shut down), we focused on building our own universal email API that can connect to any mailbox (Gmail or any other provider) without using any external API or technology, apart from the universal email protocol IMAP. The result is the ability for all users (with a Gmail account or any other email provider) to benefit from Cleanfox services and to join our panel.The impact is twofold. First, in the short term, we will reduce the size of our active usersâ€™ panel (no worries, it will still be 10â€“20x larger than any other panel in Europe). Indeed, to uphold the trust of our users and to comply with GDPR, we will not be able to reconnect automatically our users that opted in with Gmail API: we will reconnect them gradually by re-obtaining their consent with our new platform. In the meantime, we will put in production our historical users who opted in without Gmail API, and we have already recruited for months users with our new API (Gmail and non-Gmail users), that will power our platform from Day 1 of its release.Second, in the longer term, this will hugely benefit the precision of our platform as it will be even more representative by design, as the email provider is a primary discriminative variable for consumers. For many digital markets, relying on Gmail users only gives very precise information, but it can create some biases when digging further at a more granular level: this will be solved by a panel with an email provider mix closer to the reality, before any adjustments. For instance, we recruit daily between 30% to 40% Gmail users with Cleanfox v.3 in France (at a rate of 2,000 to 5,000 users per day overall): it closely matches the share of Gmail users within the population (circa 30% according to our research). In France, our new technology allows us to connect Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail (the usual suspects), but also Orange (and the vintage but still popular Wanadoo domain), laposte.net, etc. In addition to the major domains, we will connect O2, Vodafone, or AOL in the UK, GMX in Germany, Telefonica in Spain or Telenet in Belgium. Now there is no boundary to our user base!Foxbrain is the central intelligence that allows us to transform raw HTML code (emails) in precise, detailed and rich data points to empower our clients to make better decisions, on three main dimensions (i) transactions (ii) products and (iii) customers.Foxbrain has been completely revamped to be able to accommodate all email providers via the IMAP protocol and to be able to deliver data faster. The infrastructure and the algorithms powered by machine learning is what you do not see when you access our insights, but these insights are only the tip of the iceberg. The real power relies on our data flow powered by advanced technologies, and we have revamped it from top to bottom. The result is a broader range of more precise data points on digital markets.With more than 130 merchants and 20,000 brands tracked (and counting), we can now cover a broader range of markets with an increased level of quality. Indeed, the significant change that you may not notice (at least at first sight) is the active monitoring that our new platform allows, with different SLAs in terms of data integrity and quality we guarantee depending on merchant status.Plenty of our clients pushed us to go in three directions regarding which data we should provide at the product level, and we have done it!The first one was to revamp our category tree to match market standards. With 637 product categories on the verticals we cover, the new tree is neater, and you still have the opportunity to customize it in Foxwatch to match your own categories! Second, we added extra levels of categorization (up to 4 depending on categories) to dive deeper into the data. Finally, we added some additional specific enrichment fields long waited for, including specific gaming tags (e.g., platform name, franchise name), cultural goods tags (e.g., dematerialized vs. hardcover) and food delivery tags (e.g., restaurant chains).We will release a new version of our age prediction models to increase by 13pp the accuracy of age prediction. An accurate consumer age field will add to the demographics dimensions we already track and to the new customer dimension in terms of geolocation (city center vs. rural areas). Additionally, we will implement a new version of our statistical biases correction (formerly based on gender, region, and Prime membership variables), that will now include the city center and the email provider variables to increase the level of accuracy of the metrics we deliver. In addition, we are introducing an upgraded statistical methodology, based on multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) of the panel variables, to establish a new standard in terms of the statistical reliability of panel measurement. We also plan to add in the future a lot of dimensions to our customer level information (e..g., newsletter subscription and opening, cross industries consumption habits, etc.), that our new platform allows accessing.Our ambition is to let you explore the age of the consumer, where consumers shift their consumption habits rapidly in a digital environment. Being able to follow and understand them in the different dimensions of their consumption habits is a necessity, now possible with our new platform.Accurate data is useless if you cannot access it when you need it and in the way you need it, with the right level of confidence on the insights you can draw from it. This is the reason why we also beefed up Foxwatch, our 100% proprietary data analysis and visualization tool.The first significant update we will release (and have already released to beta testers clients) is a reduction of pages that cannot be displayed. It generally came from large requests made by users. But the bottom line was an error page more often that you would expect. We have already cut the situation by more than 50%, and our objective is to reach zero bugs in the short term.As the Foxwatch user base and data points count grew, we experienced sometimes slow loading times and even crashes. To solve this issue and build Foxwatch for scale, we could have relied on external service (e.g., Google Big Query), used vertical scaling (increase the power of our server) or horizontal scaling (parallelize work to multiple servers). We implemented horizontal scaling, with our proprietary system (nicknamed Small Query) that increased between 10x to 14x the speed of loading data in Foxwatch. The result? Almost instant display of any insight, whatever the request!There is a lot of science in what we do, but absolutely no magic. When we slice and dice data with too many filters, even the most extensive panel in Europe runs low on data points. It results in less reliable insights, which creates a problem for the person analyzing the data if she is not even aware of the situation.As it was complicated (or even impossible in some situations) for a Foxwatch user to know when she reached the limit in terms of data availability to draw an accurate conclusion from its analysis, we implemented an automatic alerting. When there are not enough data points to reach the maximum statistical significance, we display it with an automatic alerting in the form of a small orange triangle on the top right corner of the KPI display cell. It will feel familiar to spreadsheets users, who will recognize the same kind of altering as in Excel or Google Sheets when a formula is not correct.Our new platform will answer most of our clientsâ€™ most pressing demands, but it will above all build the foundations of our long term ability to bring the most accurate and precise market intelligence, without relying on Gmail API or any 3rd party. This a guarantee of quality, durability, and compliance of the data we deliver.We plan to release our new platform gradually during Q2 and Q3 2019 (no big bang, ed): as with any transition, there will be ups and downs, but we are confident it will benefit our clients in the long term. Information empowers people, Foxintelligenceâ€™s new platform is the best information you can get on digital markets to power your decisions.----ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Flo!

As previously reported on these pages, an international Norwegian company which suffered a catastrophic ransomware assault was forced to trawl through decades of paper files in order to perform tasks which are now entirely in the province of automation, as well as bring in retirees who had worked for the firm before the days of machines labour.Yet now, the use of anachronistic methods is being touted as an impenetrable line of defence against cyber threats. The concept came to prominence in the summer of 2018, when the local Alaskan government of Matanuska-Susitna suffered a cyber attack. However, office staff had practiced using pen and paper to resume operations in such an eventuality, and so daily operations were able to continue relatively unhindered. â€œHaving these plans and being able to go to paper and pen and manual methods was very helpful,â€ Eric Wyatt, the Matanuska-Susitna Borough IT director said. â€œWe could keep our doors open and continue to provide service to our citizens.â€This notion is somewhat out of step with conventional cyber defence doctrine, which dictates that cutting-edge attack software can only be prevented from having an effect by equally cutting-edge countermeasures. However, since 2018, the idea has gained traction; later that year, a US congressional hearing was directly advised to consider the scheme by Kevin Mandia, chief executive of the FireEye cyber security firm. â€œ[Government agencies should be required] to develop and carry out continuity-of-operations plans that practice, even for just 24 hours, going without Internet connectivity while continuing critical functions,â€ Mandia said.In response to Mandiaâ€™s address, Senator Maggie Hassan told The Washington Post: â€œEmergency preparedness including carrying out drills and real-life exercises can help save lives when terrorist attacks or natural disasters occur, and cyber attacks are no different,â€ Hassan said. â€œBoth the public and private sectors need to conduct training, simulations and planning for cyber attacks â€” and drills to practice not having Internet access for 24 hours are worth considering.â€Just how seriously the US government is taking the suggestion is arguably best demonstrated by the fact that the National Security Agency, one of Americaâ€™s principle intelligence agencies, is using â€˜retroâ€™ methods to secure critical national infrastructure (CNI) against cyber attacks. The employment of analogue and manual technology is to be introduced prior to the 2020 presidential election, the 2016 race having been plagued by accusations of foreign interference.â€œThis approach seeks to thwart even the most sophisticated cyber-adversaries who, if they are intent on accessing the grid, would have to actually physically touch the equipment, thereby making cyber attacks much more difficult,â€ said a press release as the Securing Energy Infrastructure Act, (SEIA), passed the Senate floor.When introducing the bill in 2016, U.S. Senators Angus King (I-Maine) and Jim Risch (R-Idaho) said: â€œSpecifically, it will examine ways to replace automated systems with low-tech redundancies, like manual procedures controlled by human operators.â€While the approach has its detractors, its effectiveness cannot be yet denied, despite the possible need for a return to hiring more manual labour. So far, the concept has been limited to US government application, but it is perhaps something alternative for cyber security firms in the private sector to consider.DisclaimerThe content of this article does not reflect the official opinion of Cyber Secure Central.

Soon, with the agricultural revolution (read Revolt of 1857), there came a time when cities and permanent settlements started to develop near rivers (read Ganges Canal) and human civilisation (read IIT Roorkee) started.Initially, every person or group was self-sufficient in terms of the resources they needed. With the development of civilisation, it became necessary to use the collective knowledge and effort (read IMG) to lead better lives.In a permanent settlement, there were people who practised agriculture, people who raised animals, people who provided services like transportation, and many more. But all of them had a surplus of some resource and shortage of some other. A wheat farmer had extra wheat but no meat while a poultry farmer had extra meat but no wheat. Such an imbalance of resources lead to the simultaneous existence of resource (like trunks, fans and bicycles) wastage and shortage, thus, contributing to miseries in the lives of humans.To counter this problem, humans with their collective knowledge, developed the concept of markets where people could Buy and Sell resources. Wastage of resources reduced up to a large extent and people could now get what they needed. There was happiness all over!Until the time the cities and civilisations, in general, were small (read fewer departments), it was easy to know what was happening in the different parts of the society. As the cities expanded and kingdoms grew in size (read more departments, courses and branches), it became increasingly difficult for information to travel from one corner of the kingdom to another. News of important events like festivals (Thomso? Cogni? Sangram? E-Summit?) and wars (read Hackathons and other competitions) were often missed by the people. Appointment of new generals (read Deans), royal courtiers (read HoDs) and public officers (read Professors), even a new King (read Director), was unbeknownst to a lot of citizens who were directly or indirectly affected by it. This constant lack of awareness in the society lead to miseries in the lives of humans.To counter this problem, humans with their collective knowledge, developed the concept of NoticeBoard where all the important information was displayed for the public. Finally, people were now aware of the happenings of the state and could actively take part in the activities related to them. There was happiness all over!In the rapidly advancing civilisation, the concept of educating (read electronically educating) humans started to emerge. The greatest thinkers and philosophers (read our own professors) started collecting and writing books (read the life-saving slides) for passing their knowledge to fellow students.There was no centralised collection of all the educational materials. The students relied on those (read CRs) who were in direct contact with the authors to get the books to read. Getting the books of other authors was a nightmare for many. This lack of collective storage of knowledge lead to difficulties for learners hence leading, again, to miseries in the lives of humans.To counter this problem, humans with their collective knowledge, developed the concept of libraries (read LecTut) where all the books were available for the public. People could now access all the books of all those great authors conveniently. There was happiness all over!With the rise of education, the world was becoming more and more advanced. There were competent people, some with high scores in education, some with experience in trading and business, some with experience in wars, some with all of the above. There were lots of skills which one could develop in lots of ways.With so many skilled people in the society, how could they show their skills to those offering new prospects? It was physically challenging, and often impossible for people to go and display their skills or achievements to everyone they wished to show it to. Nor was it easy for those offering certain opportunities to compare the prospective candidates based only on the information they could gather, primarily from word of mouth. This inability of conveying the academic, artistic or any other kind of worth of an individual lead, again, to miseries in the lives of people.To counter this problem, humans with their collective knowledge, developed the concept of resumes (read SHP), a document (read webpage) in which people could list out their qualifications and achievements to be conveyed to others. People now had a way of keeping a record of their notable skills to prove their self-worth. There was happiness all over!People could now display their self-worth but the problem of finding jobs still remained unsolved. There were worthy people with healthy resumes seeking opportunities but they did not where to look for work. There was a multitude of places where prospective employers could advertise available positions. With so many diverse sources like word of mouth, newspaper ads (read TPO notices), etc. , it was very easy to miss opportunities, which could have been life-changing. Moreover, it was not always the case that all the information about the opportunity was available to the applicants. These difficulties for people looking for jobs lead, again, to miseries in the lives of humans.To counter this problem, humans with their collective knowledge, developed the concept of unified job markets (read Placement Online) where all the prospective employers and applicants could register themselves. People could now know all the opportunities and know all about the opportunities available for them. There was happiness all over!In all this humdrum of life, be it filling your stomach, training your brain, mastering your crafts, it was the heart which started to suffer. People were so lost in using the collective knowledge and efforts in improving their professional lives that they nearly forgot about the soul, deep within the bodies. All the effort was done for development, but now there was a need to spice up lives. All that was needed was a little touch of love in the monotonous lives of human-cum-machines.To counter this problem, humans with their collective knowledge and collective love (read IMG, with love), developed the concept of valentines (read Connect-e-Dil) to connect hearts all over. A red rose was no more just another flower. There were colours of love in the air and love became as colourful as a rainbow. There was not just happiness all over, but also love!It is the human collective knowledge and effort, with love, which has been solving the problems of humanity since time immemorial. Not all the problems are solved yet but nor is the collective knowledge stopped functioning. It is we, the humans, who can be the part of this collective knowledge, directly or indirectly, and spread happiness forever.

A transition from fossil fuels to clean energy could be a major step in reducing our carbon dioxide emissions, but focusing on carbon emissions is only half the battle. The gains from such a transition can be seen as a temporary fix or even worse, a distraction from the real roots of the problem.Firstly, almost all clean energy technologies need rare earth minerals for production and storage. These rare earths are finite, and the shift towards clean energy is expected to drive tremendous growth in demand for those minerals, which in turn would trigger higher mining activity and depletion of those resources.In the absence of efficient reuse and recycling â€” which despite the vast research effort on recycling accounted to less than 1% in 2011 â€” or the development of technologies which use lower amounts of rare earths, following a path consistent with stabilisation of atmospheric CO2 at 450 ppm may lead to an increase of more than 2600% for certain rare earth minerals over the next 25 years, if the present needs are representative of future needs, according to a study led by a team of researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.In addition to issues of abundance, rare earth mining and extraction procedures constitute massive exploitation of the earthâ€™s resources and deteriorate soil and water ecosystems. One of the biggest concerns about mining from the primary ore deposits is the resulting radioactive stockpiles. Other negative effects of mining include severe biodiversity loss, land use change, flooding and air pollution.As a professor, Karen Smith Stegen of Jacobs University in Bremen reports that at the moment China is the predominant supplier of rare earth minerals with about 90% of global production, and also dominates the processing processes, particularly the less abundant, heavy rare earth minerals, which means that many rare earth minerals extracted outside of China must be exported to China in order to enter value chains. Despite this other researchers, like Jacobson and Delucchi from Stanford University, demonstrate we can generate enough clean energy to power our current and near future demands, however, it fails to prove whether it can work in the long run. In other words, as vital as it can be, a transition to clean energy can lead us into a new era of energy-related geopolitics and resource scarcity and therefore, it might not be the only answer to achieving a sustainable future.Secondly, the fact that technology does not always deliver its own prospects is overlooked. In the transport sector, for example, electric cars have recently emerged as a promising solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nonetheless, their production exhibit the possibility for significant increases in human toxicity, freshwater eco-toxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and metal depletion impacts, following a life cycle assessment of conventional and electric vehicles conducted by Hawkins and others at Yale University.Despite the abundance of research focused on clean energy, finding new and better materials and more efficient designs, the adoption of any new technology will be a lengthy process and could take at least couple of years. We rely on technologies that are either imperfect or, even worse, have not been yet invented! In a situation where time is not on our side, invention only defies mandated timelines.All the above mean that by simply shifting from one source of energy to another, we overlook the fact that new technologies would demand the same structures that put us where we are in the first place. This rigorous energy debate marginalises other problems such as deforestation, industrial production, livestock farming and landfills which are major sources of carbon dioxide and methane. We even tend to overlook the effect of methane, despite the fact that it has a much higher Global Warming Potential (GWP). If we keep razing forests, expanding industrial agriculture and livestock, producing more goods, and filling more landfill sites, it is simply naive to think we can stop climate change with technological innovations.What is then the problem? We are aiming at the tip of the iceberg. No matter how much greener we make our future, there is one fundamental challenge hindering any major changes that we often forget to think about: questioning the logic of our current economic system and the unjustified aim for growth. Without a doubt, there are absolute physical limits to growth and resource extraction defined by the laws of thermodynamics. And even though we cannot predict when or where such limits will be encountered, it is obvious that they exist and that exponential growth poses a serious danger. The current economic system is now very large relative to the ecosystem that sustains it. As Tim Jackson, the famous critic of growing economy, warranted: â€œQuestioning growth is deemed to be the act of lunatics, idealists and revolutionaries. But question it we must.â€ The tendency of economic growth supporters to dismiss this obvious ecological truth has been remarkable. Despite the benefits behind technological advancement, it would be a gamble to rely on efficiency and technological innovations to fully decouple economic growth from material throughput while growth continues. With this in mind, to â€˜succeedâ€™ would be to destroy our planet.The conventional dilemmas of modern technological society appear to be able to resurface, whatever the technology we innovate. Hence, technological optimism should not escape the need for fundamental social change. A wholesale change in patterns of consumption and a substantial reduction in resource intensity teamed with intentional shrinking of production are the least that will be needed to have a chance of achieving ecological sustainability and remaining within environmental limits in order to avoid an inevitable collapse of the resource base in the not-too-distant future. These imminent prospects are perfectly epitomized in Alf Hornborgâ€™s words: â€œMoney and technology together constitute a global game in which most players remain unaware of the extent to which the rules are both arbitrary and mutable, and in which the stakes are the relative distribution of workloads and environmental burdens.â€ This should constitute both a take away lesson and a wake up call before our time runs out.This article was published in The Beam #6 â€” Subscribe now for more----11TheBeamMagazineThe Beam unites the changemakers and innovators in the Global Climate Action movement to amplify their voices.

They cover customer identity and billing information, registries of numbers and licenses, supply chain management data, configurations of equipment, maintenance and service logs, geospatial locations of equipment, and hundreds of other uses. Some are efficient and fault/fraud-tolerant, while others can be expensive or slow for the various participants.Potentially, these systems and processes can be optimised by blockchain, ultimately reducing costs or removing friction. Notably, blockchain can be implemented in telecommunications and data management with the purpose of fraud prevention and mitigation. Telecoms suffer significantly because of fraudulence schemes every year. According to a survey, 38.1 billion US dollars in losses were attributed to fraudulent schemesÂ¹. To deal with identity fraud, companies can use the blockchain to verify every individualâ€™s identity. Furthermore, they could also link their devices to the identity on the network. Damage to the telecom is mitigated â€” in the event where oneâ€™s identity is compromised, it will only affect intermediate devices linked to it, and not the overall network.Another big problem is the roaming fraud. This will get sorted out using permissioned blockchain instead of a public one. Every operator that allows roaming can connect to that environment. So, if an individual meets specific rules, then a smart contract can be executed to settle the costs.Identity-as-a-Service. The company can provide eSIM solution and identity and authentication services based on cryptographic identity, this will decrease costs of implementing identity management and as an additional revenue stream. Identity-management of individuals and devices, creating open marketplaces for short-term contracts, offering enterprise managed services to guarantee â€œanti-tamperâ€ for IoT data, micropayments for content, and many more. Any telecommunication company can add an identity management system with their already existing features. Managing identity would allow them to help users manage their Idâ€™s across, applications, devices, and organizations with only one single password.If you are a later-stage (minimally attained series A funding) startup, or traditional company with a strong business case for using blockchain technology to address the challenges in the data and telecommunications space â€” we want you on board.Our Accelerator program will commence in April 2019, and run for a period of 5 months.Head over to our website for more details on how to be a part of what weâ€™re building:w: https://www.tribeaccelerator.coe: hello@tribeaccelerator.coFacebook: tribeaccelerator.coInstagram: @tribeaccelerator.coLinkedin: tribeaccelerator.coÂ¹ A survey of telecom service providers in 2015 estimates the losses due to fraud to 38.1 billion US dollars (Source: â€œ2015 Global Fraud Loss Survey,â€ http://cfca.org/fraudlosssurvey, September 2015)----First Singapore Government Supported Blockchain AcceleratorTribe Accelerator--Tribe Accelerator--Tribe Accelerator--Tribe Accelerator--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alex Mathers--220Scott H.

Has it occurred to you that you log in to message someone, or for another specific purpose and end up losing track, gazing at Coachella posts sighing how you wish you were there rather than stuck over here, crawling your way to the finish line of the semester? And those short makeup videos & oh-so-freaking-intriguing pictures that you canâ€™t stop staring. And you ask yourself to â€œstopâ€¦waitâ€¦I came to do something else.â€We have long gotten into the habit of posting pictures ranging from the breakfast we eat to the dinner outs (oh and not to forget the tropical summer dream vacay ones. Duh.) Social media undoubtedly becomes dangerous when used excessively. Very easy to put into words, but harder to acknowledge. Usually, celebrities and influencers having thousands and millions of followers tend to be idolized, leading us, followers, following like laggards. Comparing our lives to that of the celebrities, gazing picture-perfect dolled up faces for events, travel posts and fancy hotel stays render us envious & jealous when we are in another nook of the world going through a tough time. But who is really to be blamed? Social media users rarely get to see the BTS, the bland normality of these famous celebrities. We only see what they want us to see. We barely see the after parties where everyone gets wasted, throwing up gruesomely on the floor. We are rarely shown the insecurities, flaws and errors of the many people we follow and idolize. We only see what they choose to show us. And thatâ€™s where many of us are trapped.â€œUnhealthy cultures create addiction. Healthy cultures create social bonds.â€-Simon SinekIt is a choice to use social media or not. But if you do use it, you should be aware of the consequences and the things you are accountable for. Personally, three of the most intelligent & motivational speakers are Jay Shetty, Gary Vee & Simon Sinek, since they address issues that many of us donâ€™t necessarily realize and they often highlight social mediaâ€™s dangerous consequences. Gary Vee is one hell of a man because he shakes you and gives brutally honest answers that are enough to prevent you from comparing your lives to other people (usually in terms of success & wealth), wishing and leading you towards executing your goals. Odd enough as it sounds, dopamine is a chemical that gives you the â€œfeel goodâ€ experience when alcohol or drug is consumed, and the same thing is released in our body when we get a like on our photos. (Thatâ€™s not me saying it).In this era, it is high time not to just surf for content that makes up of our hobbies and pastime. We have a powerful gadget to browse for more interesting, important topics and learn. We should break the stereotype of using the internet for YouTube, Facebook or Instagram, and go towards TED Talks and documentaries, explore theories and intellectualsâ€™ stands on matters that concern the ways life works. Social media often shows the bright side of life, rather than â€œWhat took him/her to reach to that stageâ€. When we really just think about it, the internet does not comprise solely of fancy content.Enough blaming social media. We can be too selective towards the consumption of our media content, leading us to ignore the significant, thought-provoking content. One of the videos of Gary Vee (Google him, would you?) attacks a 22year old by telling her â€œevery second you think about what somebody else has is taking away time to create something for yourselfâ€ and that shit struck me hard. Iâ€™m not 21 yet. Phew.Truth is, we often are so impatient, I am too many times impatient to become successful, that it makes me settle for short-term success & satisfaction. But Gary Vee ensures that working extremely hard & bleeding ourselves, will provide long term results. All we need to do is to trust the process & enjoy every step of it, which according to me, careerwise, could be the best thing I could ever hear before hitting 21.â€œSocial media tools are designed to be addictiveâ€ and I couldnâ€™t agree more. Being a fellow Instagrammer since 2015, the number of minutes spent on it started doubling up. I constantly checked for â€œnotificationsâ€ and replies from my best friend where we share the funniest memes and react to it in our DMs. Relatable? At the end of the day, I realized how addicted I was, and I pondered â€œWhat did you get in return, in real life?â€ (P.s: Itâ€™s 2019, and Iâ€™m still wonderingâ€¦.) Robert Sapolsky labels looking at your phone as â€œThe magic of Maybeâ€. As crazy as it sounds, it does make sense. It is when you look at your phone and you think â€œmaybe thereâ€™s a text, an Instagram notification from the photo you just posted or checking who viewed your story.â€ Why is that so? In a video that I watched, the speaker explained that many major social media companies hire individuals called the â€œAttention engineersâ€. They borrow principles from Las Vegas Casino gambling, amongst other places, to make their products as addictive as possible. Apparently, the technology companies control the dial for when and how long your profile photo shows up on feeds so that they can â€œorchestrateâ€ it and more people end up liking your profile photo for a delayed period of time.â€œAlcohol is not bad, too much alcohol is bad. Gambling is fun. Too much gambling is dangerous.â€As Simon Sinek puts it, just like over-eating makes us unhealthy and is detrimental to our organs, the obsessive utilization of Social media can be toxic, if not deadly.----1Writing enthusiast who loves baking & Makeup!

MeckeFollow--ListenShareWin-Loss Interviews are a market research technique designed to learn market facts from customers and prospects. When you Google â€˜ Win-Loss Interview Questions â€˜ there are over 77,900,000 results. We have found from years of experience conducting Win-Loss Analysis projects that there are some questions you should always ask. The question set you use needs to be tailored to meet the research objectives of your project. We have found that including two or three of these questions can significantly improve the results of your project.Win-Loss Interviews are usually 20 to 30 minute phone calls. They are conducted by an independent interviewer that was not involved in the sales cycle. This ensures that the interviewee can speak freely and openly, especially about sensitive topics. The interview covers 10 to 15 open ended questions about the customer or prospects experience with the company. The questions usually include:We have found that by focusing your questions around certain topics you can gain more valuable insights to help your company improve its messaging, positioning, packaging, pricing, and sales practices.Almost all technology sales cycles start with some type of trigger. Why did a prospect decide that now was the time to begin evaluating potential software solutions? There could be dozens of reasons why a prospect decided now was the time to start looking at new solutions. Was it an outcome of some type of annual business planning process? Was there some type of business opportunity that came up that needed new or different technology support? Was there a problem with an existing solution that needed to be fixed? Did a change in government or industry regulations require a new solution to ensure compliance? Did a major customer or supplier mandate a change?Understanding these triggers is important. Marketing and sales programs are designed to tackle repeatable opportunities in the marketplace. The majority of todayâ€™s buys journey occurs before the prospect contacts a vendorâ€™s sales team. Marketing materials (blogs, case studies, etc.) can be more effectively designed by understanding the conditions in the market that encourage a customer to start investigating new solutions. Win-Loss interviews provide a great opportunity to understand why a customer started their buying journey.In 2019 it is accepted that prospects spend a lot of time investigating potential solutions before ever contacting a vendorâ€™s sales team. Sirius Decisions reports that 67% of the buyerâ€™s journey is complete before a vendorâ€™s sales team is contacted. Gartner reinforces this point:https://www.gartner.com/en/sales-service/insights/b2b-buying-journeyUnderstanding the buyerâ€™s journey before they officially contact your sales organization is critical. The relentless nature of todayâ€™s sales force automation solutions can pummel a prospect with inquiries and emails. Most buyers defer contacting a vendorâ€™s sales team to avoid the constant harassment (Are you ready for a demo today? Schedule 15 minutes on my calendar for a quick call, etc.) The open ended nature of a Win-Loss Interview allows your organization to explore what types of web resources a prospect found helpful or hurtful during their journey.Another important topic to explore was if a purchase was included in a formal budget. Large purchases (>$10,000) usually require formal approval. Purchases this large usually need to be budgeted in advance. Understanding the dynamics of a prospectâ€™s financial budgeting process is critical.As the market has shifted from primarily on-premise solutions to Software-as-a-Service budget practices have evolved. Major on-premise solutions were often treated as capital purchases that were amortized over many years. Capital budgets are usually developed and approved once a year. SaaS solutions, with recurring monthly payments, are usually treated as operating expenses and are not capitalized. Smaller SaaS purchases, like those who can be paid with a company credit card, often do not have to be budgeted in advance. Larger payments (e.g. >$5,000/month) typically require some type of budgetary approval.If budgets are only developed once a year then a vendor has to position their solution well in advance of the budget process. Win-Loss Interview provide a mechanism to explore the budget development, approval, and release processes.The credibility of Internet sources has become more critical since buyers are spending more of their time doing product research on the web. According to TrustRadius vendor websites are the least trustworthy source of information for buyers:Find out more here.After industry analyst reports buyers consider user reviews to be a trustworthy source of information. Sites like Capterra, Software Advice, & G2Crowd have become extremely popular. These sites provide both positive and negative reviews about vendor solutions:Most also provide side-by-side comparisons of competing products. Asking buyers if they have visited these sites can help an enterprise better understand how buyers are evaluating them and comparing them to competing solutions.Many large scale enterprises will only buy from vendors that have been rated as leaders by key industry analysts like Gartner, Forrester, or Ovum. You should ask customers/prospects if they reviewed any industry analyst research during their evaluation.A buyerâ€™s prior use of a solution in another job or company can have a significant impact on their purchasing behavior. As noted in the Trust Radius study, the most credible source of information about a solution was the buyerâ€™s prior use of a solution. While positive experiences can significantly help a sales cycle, negative experiences â€” even from years ago â€” can become significant blockers.One thing that is important to confirm early in a Win-Loss Interview is if the buyer issued a request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase. RFPs become common for large purchases once a market problem has reached the early majority stage of the technology adoption life cycle.By the time the market has evolved to the early majority stage the problem it addresses has been recognized by a large number of enterprises. The solutions to the problems also have enough commonality that they can readily compared.If your solution is in the middle to later stages of the TALC asking questions about RFPs makes a lot of sense. RFPs provide a lot of information about buyerâ€™s requirements, priorities, and decision making processes. By raising this question early in an interview, the interviewer can adjust their line of questioning.Gartner has noted that 6 to 8 people are often involved in the purchasing decision making process. It is helpful to explore during an interview what roles in a buyerâ€™s company were involved at each stage of the buying journey. Gartner emphasizes that the buying process is no longer linear, but iterative in nature. This means that more people have input and can serve as gatekeepers through the entire buying process.There is almost an endless list of questions you would like to ask in a Win-Loss Analysis interview. Unfortunately the time and patience of interviewees is limited. Win-Loss questions need to limited to those key questions that will help you achieve the research objectives of your project. Focused questions like those covered in this post are some ways you can meet and exceed the research objectives.Originally published at https://win-loss.agency on July 26, 2019.----25 year enterprise software executive.

In this blog post you can read about Amsterdamâ€™s tech scene, the most desired software developer skills, how much developers earn, what kind of conferences, accelerators and incubators there are and you can also get to know the companies that have decided to place their headquarters here or open an office in the area.First of all, letâ€™s talk a little bit about Amsterdam. This city is mostly known for its canals, bikes and Red Light District, but few people know that it is one of the most liveable and safest cities in the world and is constantly ranked on top when it comes to work-life balance, happiness or education.It is a really â€œgezelligâ€ city. This Dutch word doesnâ€™t have an exact English equivalent, its meaning includes everything from cozy to friendly, from comfortable to relaxing, and from enjoyable to gregarious. You will hear this word a lot if you decide to move to the Dutch capital!As for LGBTQ-friendliness; Amsterdam ranks second in the world. It also has one of the best Prides.The high quality of life, the relatively low cost of living (compared to other tech cities), an airport with great connections to anywhere in the world and the political and economic stability makes this capital popular for international talent and companies.The Dutch capital was named the best tech city in Europe to work at by Hubspot, and is the 4th in the world ranking following New York, San Francisco and London.The size of the city and one of the most bike friendly environments in the world makes this flourishing capital more pleasant. Thanks to the excellent quality of life and the well-educated workforce tech firms are thriving in this area and attracting new businesses and talent.When it comes to the language, you do not have to worry about language barriers! The Netherlands is almost a completely bilingual country, 90% of its residents speak English and the country is ranked second in the EF English Proficiency Index.The tech scene is very internationally-oriented and since developers come from all around the world most companies use English as a business language. Many of the big tech firms have over 70% non-Dutch employees in their tech teams.Due to the high amount of expats, the feeling of community and belonging helps the people who relocated and makes them more comfortable to work and live in Amsterdam. Companies like Try Catch enjoy to organize events for tech people in Amsterdam where they can make friends and just have fun!As mentioned before, Amsterdam attracts highly skilled tech talent and tech companies, there are approximately around 215.000 professional tech developers in the city. Around 25% of Amsterdamâ€™s population work in the tech sector and the salaries for tech professionals are the highest in Europe.The employment in the tech sector also grew in the past years by 12%.But who and which positions are the most wanted?The most wanted are developers and data scientists. The cores of every tech team: front and back end developers are also highly important. Tech companies struggle to find good data scientists, these positions are constantly open and sometimes it takes up more than 12 weeks to fill in these roles.As the industry grows rapidly, companies are looking for more medior and senior talent. They usually donâ€™t have time to train junior talent that is not able to fully understand the systems, development languages and techniques. However, some scale-ups indicated that balancing 20â€“30% of senior and 70â€“80% of junior talent was efficient enough to meet demands while improving the business too. Bigger tech companies, however, are overall open to junior tech people, since they can still be formed to the company.Other research on Europeâ€™s tech scene also highlighted, that software engineers (including mobile) are the most difficult employees to attract (Balderton, 2016). They are followed by data scientists and machine learning and cloud service professionals.The skills which are the most difficult to find are front end developers, full stack engineers, back end java developers and any kind of data scientists and machine learning professionals.Developer salaries in the Netherlands are ranked 9th globally and 7th in Europe.Junior developer salaries in the Netherlands range from about â‚¬36K to â‚¬60K, medior developersâ€™ salaries from â‚¬36K to â‚¬64K and senior developersâ€™ salaries from â‚¬41K to â‚¬75K. (Stack Overflow (2018) and our own data). The figure above shows the average salaries for different kind of positions and experience.Amsterdam has a high variety of tech companies and is a key tech hub for software, travel, fintech and life sciences & health industries. There are more than 69.000 jobs in tech companies and open positions in fields like SaaS grew by 30% in the past 2 years.There are almost 1700 tech companies in the Dutch capital from seed startups like Crisp, to scale-ups like Picnic to big tech giants like Booking.com or Uber.Startups are the dutch economyâ€™s number 1 growth engine and companies younger than 5 years add the most jobs. Dutch tech companies raised around â‚¬500 million in 2018, amazing right?Thanks to Amsterdamâ€™s flourishing tech scene more and more tech and startup events are present in the city. The most commonly known are Amsterdam Eweek, Hackers and Founders, React, The Next Web Conference and Amsterdam Capital Week.To help startups grow, there are several incubators and accelerators, such as Antler, Ace Incubator, Booking Booster, Collider, Rockstart and many more. These accelerators are usually providing training, business support, office space and help startuppers grow their network.To summarise, Amsterdam is and will be a great tech hub to work and live in.

Because of their ability to create advanced artificial intelligence, quantum computers can be used to simulate the required chemical reactions for new material or drug development. Building quantum computers is a very difficult process because their components, quantum bits or â€œqubitsâ€, have to be kept in highly controlled environments.A team of researchers from the UK and France have demonstrated that it may be possible to build a quantum computer by using standard silicon-based electronic components. If possible, large-scale manufacturing of quantum computers can occur much sooner than predicted.Unlike traditional computers (which store information in binary bits that are either â€œ0â€ or â€œ1â€), quantum computers use qubits which can store information as a combination of â€œ0â€ and â€œ1â€ â€” at the same time! This is possible because of the law of superposition.Currently, quantum computer development is still in its early stages. Several hardware technologies are available, however, none are dominating the â€œyoungâ€ field, yet. The most advanced prototypes of quantum computers have been made by either trapping ions in a vacuum chamber or superconducting circuits, which are kept at a near absolute zero temperature. The biggest challenge with assembling the computers is scaling up the small models into larger, interconnected qubit systems and the technology which might allow for this to happen is the silicon transistor â€” the basic device used in all microprocessors and memory chips.Due to Mooreâ€™s Law, silicon devices have been miniaturised over the years to become only a few tens of atoms wide, which is the scale that triggers the laws of quantum physics. However, there is a physical limit that is halting any further miniaturisation of silicon transistors. Nevertheless, new uses of silicon technology are providing the possibility of encoding a quantum bit of information into each silicon transistor and then using them to build quantum computers. By reusing the same technology used by the microchip industry for the past 60 years, costs for producing the silicon quantum bits can be reduced. Furthermore, current engineering and processing methods used in the development of modern microelectronics can be adapted to build powerful quantum processors.The experiments conducted by research teams at Cambridge University, Hitachi R&D, University College London and CEA-LETI, in collaboration with The Conversation, were recently published in Nature Electronics.The teams applied engineering solutions from conventional circuits to attach different quantum devices on a silicon chip. Additionally, they developed a circuit which operates at near absolute zero temperature and uses commercial transistors (some small enough to act as qubits). Their results suggest that the integration of conventional and quantum electronics can be the (currently) best available process to advance quantum computer production.The future of quantum technology could be made of silicon!----hope your dreams come true :)angel--angel--angel--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Clive Thompson--19Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

The power of machine learning has been used in business sectors ranging from front end development to architecture, passing through management at all levels. A particular trend which has been developing in the past couple of years would definitely be related to the desire to automate warehousing processes, letâ€™s analyze how this is done with examples and case studies, starting from the biggest one: Alibaba.[Related Article: Redefining Robotics: Next Generation Warehouses]Machine Learning has always been a topic with strong connections to robotics and automated pieces of technology, therefore, once robots have become the industry standard within most of the production chains worldwide, ML followed accordingly. Machine learning is used in warehouses to provide rules to robots on how to react to overload, a small error in production and everything in between, without any form of manual input. Of course, in order for this to properly work, the entire setup must be organized using a variety of tools, ranging from control automation to error resolving applications. Most of the warehousing facilities which embraced machine learning as a whole have been working with a combination of Python-based software (controlling the machines which were used within the warehouse) and C++ ones (determining whether or not certain errors should have been fixed).The biggest example of automation within warehousing management would be related to Alibaba and their recent usage of machine learning to control the robots which are, currently, taking care of the storage in their biggest stocking facility in China. Many analysts have dissected the usage of robots for warehousing management, and data has shown how the Alibaba experiment was able to increase the companyâ€™s productivity by a net 70% just within the first monthâ€™s timeframe. The usage of Machine Learning in Alibaba has been studied massively from both a business and technology-related perspective, leading to the conclusion to which robotics, when properly set up, could guarantee results in an extremely short timeframe.Itâ€™s no secret that every time something revolutionary proves results, many will try to use it within their business facilities. The Alibaba example has started an entire wave of companies approaching automation, from big to small, given the exponential results achieved in such a timeframe. Itâ€™s easy, in 2019, to see job adverts for Python developers within warehouses, supply chains and related, given the willingness of automating bulky sections of warehousing by those who seek a fast growth.Itâ€™s safe, at this stage, to say that the market will heavily move towards technologically-advanced applications for warehousing (in general) and this is something which (possibly) will move an overall â€œold schoolâ€ business sector towards technology, thoroughly.Yes, it is. Without going through over complicated technicalities, the usage of neural networks and Python scripting would be enough to control, automate and auto-resolve errors within every single automated feature a warehouse may have. From stock management to the actual supply chain, the usage of a simple neural network-controlled head computer will be enough to automatically control and process every single small, medium or large task within the premise.To reference, many machine learning courses are now focusing on specific warehousing control, confirmation of the above-mentioned statement.[Related Article: 4 Examples of Businesses Solving Problems with AI]Itâ€™s no secret that 2016,17 and 18 were the years where technology has developed massively towards automation, robotics and everything in between, confirming its powerhouse in this 2019. In the future, we can safely expect automation features becoming more and more prominent in this industry segment.Original post here.Read more data science articles on OpenDataScience.com, including tutorials and guides from beginner to advanced levels!

The ascent from an exclusively terrestrial species to masters of the skies hasnâ€™t been without its fair share of turbulence, but the steady march of progress has ultimately landed us at a point in history where the idea of flying half-way around the globe is now as mundane as popping to the shops for a loaf of bread.From Leonardo Da Vinciâ€™s famous sketches, to the Wright Brothersâ€™ historic achievement of 1903, then Frank Whittleâ€™s crazy idea of a propless plane to what should be considered the zenith in our quest to conquer the skies: reaching space and ultimately landing on the moon in 1969 (read more about the patents that got us there here) the journey is littered with milestones, each worthy of a blog topic in its own right, but our focus today is not what we can do in the air, but what we canâ€™tâ€¦ or can we?For all the benefits of modern air travel, it still lacks that final element that will satisfy our inner Icarus. Cockpits, levers, joysticks and even seats maintain a barrier between man and nature. When we, just like those Paleolithic boys, look up in awe at the birds, it is solo-flight we dream of. To slip the surly bonds of earth, climb up into the wide blue yonder, alone, unencumbered by machinery or fuselage, to truly be free, has been humanityâ€™s real dream all along. And, up until now, it has remained just that.Weâ€™ve been teased many times over the years. Mainly appearing in works of fiction, weâ€™ve been tormented by fantastic images of solo-flight in comics, sci-fi movies, cartoons, toys and video games.Most tantalising of all was the 1984 LA Olympics opening ceremony, the flight lasted a mere 15 seconds and the pilot (Bill Suitor) barely covered 100 yards, but had something no comic, movie or toy etc hadâ€¦itwasreal.We all expected the creativity afterburners to kick in and for personal flight devices to become the norm by the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. Alas, innovation stalled yet again, and developments dropped off the radar all too quickly.We had to wait until the current decade for companies like JetLev to return â€˜jetpackâ€™ to the common lexicon. Donâ€™t get us wrong - they look like great fun. And, while weâ€™ll begrudgingly concede that technically there are â€˜jetsâ€™ of water involved, weâ€™re happy to distance ourselves from the rest of the pack and say: itâ€™s not a jetpack, and itâ€™s not really flying is it?As it turns out, itâ€™s the pack thatâ€™s the problem. Enter â€˜Gravity Industriesâ€™ and their â€˜wearable flight system with propulsion assemblies worn on a userâ€™s bodyâ€™ (GB patent #2559971), itâ€™s more of a Jet suit.Their revolutionary design removes most of the rigid frame elements found in existing systems and places small turbines on the userâ€™s arms. This results in a much more natural and, as the provider of â€˜intuitive patent intelligenceâ€™ dare we say, intuitive flying experience by allowing users to steer with their hands, similar to Iron Man in the Marvel films; so similar in fact that the patent examiner actually cited the 2008 film as an â€˜Xâ€™ document in the search report.So it looks like the wait may finally be over, the flying suit weâ€™ve been promised all these years is now a reality. Weâ€™d highly recommend you make yourself a cuppa, visit the Gravity Industries website or their YouTube channel, sit back, relax and be mesmerised by about an hour of high octane jet suit porn.For the stats nerds out there:The current jet suit is primarily designed for racing, rescue and emergency and, of course, military. Just last month CEO, founder and chief test pilot Richard Browning completed a number of test flights to and from Royal Navy ships in The Channel. More widespread use is something Gravity see in the future; Mr Browning says: â€œAs we improve the efficiency and ease of use, there is the potential for mass transit. We have developed something that allows you to move human beings around in a completely unprecedented wayâ€. Fuel efficiency appears to be the major challenge at the moment (the suits consume about a gallon of fuel per minute in their current form) but Gravity is working on a solution with an electric version already in development.We can confirm that GB â€˜971 is indeed the first and currently, only patent for such a style of jet suit. It has been classified in CPC class B64C39/026 â€” â€˜Aircraft for use as a personal propulsion unitâ€™, and together with traditional jet pack designs and other â€˜aircraft not otherwise provided forâ€™ (patent office speak), is part of a general upward trend in filings in this technology area. Now their idea has been published, and is visible to the wider community, Gravity are looking forward to some healthy competition to accelerate the innovation trend. Browning also says: â€œthroughout history when two human beings have said â€˜I think mineâ€™s faster than yoursâ€™ that does push the envelopeâ€.We canâ€™t decide if itâ€™s the thought of soaring majestically through air like an eagle that weâ€™re most excited by, or simply a way to avoid the Picadilly line at rush hour. Either way, when we have a spare Â£340,000, weâ€™ll be on our way to Selfridges.Whatâ€™s your favourite fictional jetpack?

LawsFollow--ListenShareâ€œIn many applications now it would be desirable to make multiple devices on a single piece of silicon in order to be able to make interconnections between the devices as part of the manufacturing process.â€Robert Noyce, January 23, 1959This typically understated entry in his patent notebook by Robert Noyce, then General Manager of Fairchild Semiconductor in Palo Alto, California, 60 years ago today led to the creation of the first practical integrated circuit (IC) and the fundamental techniques that continue to drive the computer chip industry and the modern digital world.Noyce received the National Medal of Science for his work in 1979 and, together with Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments, is celebrated as co-inventor of the IC. While Kilby and Noyce both made critical contributions to the technology, their efforts were the culmination of many approaches to building such a device by scientists and engineers worldwide.This article describes some of this work that started just a couple of years after the invention of the transistor in 1947.Integrated circuits comprise the basic building blocks of todayâ€™s electronic systems. Also known as a computer chip or microchip, an IC is an analog and/or digital circuit together with internal connections deposited on a single piece of semiconducting material. Jack Morton, head of transistor manufacturing at Bell Telephone Laboratories, described an early conception of such a circuit. In a 1949 internal report he noted: â€œImagine a technique in whichâ€¦the connecting leads and passive elements are â€˜printedâ€™ in one continuous fabrication process. â€¦We do not know the technology of doing these thingsâ€¦ Here then is the challenge.â€By 1952, G. W. A. Dummer, a manager at the Telecommunications Research Establishment, in Malvern, England suggested that technology had advanced to the point that: â€œWith the advent of the transistor and the work in semiconductors generally, it seems now possible to envisage electronic equipment in a solid block with no connecting wires.â€ Although Dummerâ€™s own efforts took nearly a decade to bear fruit [1], other researchers did succeed in producing working devices in the years before the Kilby and Noyce efforts.Within a few years of the transistorâ€™s invention, scientists across the globe pursued the idea of manufacturing multiple devices on a single chip. Using the original Bell Labsâ€™ point-contact structure, Werner Jacobi at Siemens, Germany filed a patent for a single-chip, five-transistor amplifier in 1949. Sidney Darlington of Bell Telephone Laboratories patented circuits with two and three junction transistors in 1953. And in 1957 Yasuro Tarui fabricated a â€œquadrapoleâ€ transistor, a form of unipolar (field-effect transistor) and a bipolar junction transistor on the same chip, at MITIâ€™s Electrotechnical Laboratory near Tokyo. [2] All these devices featured designs where several transistors could share a common active area with no electrical isolation to separate them from each other.Certain complex counting and switching circuits formed a class of special purpose integrated functions that could also be accomplished without requiring electrical isolation between the active devices. Using a network of RC (resistor-capacitor) elements on a single germanium chip, Harwick Johnson designed a complete phase shift oscillator circuit in 1953 at RCA in New Jersey. While his device did not yield a commercial product, his interest in integrating complete electronic functions continued when he supervised Torkel Wallmarkâ€™s work on a shift register for the Air Force. Under the title â€œIntegrated Semiconductor Devicesâ€ an article in the RCA Laboratories annual report for 1957 included a photograph of Wallmarkâ€™s â€œintegrated device which combines in one unit the functions to be performed by a whole assembly of capacitors, resistors, amplifiers and switches.â€ [3]At IBM, Poughkeepsie, NY in 1954, Joseph Logue supervised Rick Dillâ€™s design of an integrated ring-counter using â€œdouble-base diodes.â€ Dill succeeded in building a single silicon chip with four stable states, essentially a four-bit ring counter. The same year saw the launch of an effort to create a similar counter at Bell Labs. Led by Ian Ross, who would later become President of Bell Labs, H. H. Loar and L. A. Dâ€™Asaro fabricated a â€œstepping transistorâ€, a four-stage ring counter that replaced 8 transistors, & dozens of diodes, resistors & capacitors with a single silicon chip, in 1955. [4]Both the Bell and IBM counters were based on a four-layer diode structure originally conceived by William Shockley who realized that a PNPN device offered two stable operating conditions. As a switch that could remain in one of two states, he saw it as a solid-state replacement for mechanical crosspoint switches in the Bell Telephone system. Equivalent to a circuit comprising two transistors, a diode, and two resistors, Shockleyâ€™s obsession with implementing this integrated function at his own start-up company in Mountain View, California, led to the 1957 departure of eight key scientists, who then founded Fairchild Semiconductor. Although Shockley eventually moved the device into pilot production, it was rendered obsolete by more general purpose IC functions produced by his ex-employees at their new company.Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments, Dallas managed the companyâ€™s program of circuit miniaturization for aerospace applications. Previous approaches, such the PNPN devices described above, had produced truly integrated devices but offered only a limited set of useful circuit functions. Kilby realized that if he could manufacture each circuit component as a unique physical element within the semiconductor material, designers could then connect them into any desired configuration. [5]On September 12, 1958, Kilby demonstrated a phase-shift oscillator prototype built with two germanium transistor chips containing distinct transistor, capacitor, and resistor components. Aided by technicians Pat Harbrecht and Tom Yeargan, he connected the two chips into an oscillator circuit using fine gold wires. One week later they produced an amplifier. T.I. announced Kilbyâ€™s Solid Circuit Semiconductor Network concept in March 1959 and introduced its first commercial device, the two chip Type 502 Silicon Bistable Multivibrator, one year later.Although several components could be formed on a single bar of material, TIâ€™s approach required careful handcrafting of each unit. Electrical isolation between components involved etching â€œweird shapesâ€ in the surrounding material [6] and making connections between them required attaching wires, called flying-wires, above the surface of the chip. This was not a practical production technique and only a few dozen solid circuits were shipped to customers for evaluation.Beginning in 1957, Westinghouse Electric pursued research that led to a contract to develop â€œmolecularâ€ electronic devices for the U. S. Air Force. Based on the ideas of MIT professor Arthur von Hippel, this concept emerged many years later in the form of nanotechnology but in the near term led to a series of integrated analog circuits known as Functional Electronic Blocks (FEBs). In 1959, John D. Husher at the Youngwood, PA facility cut grooves across the surface of power transistor chips to create islands of discrete component elements that he connected with flying wires into FEBs such as audio amplifiers, detectors, and filters. [7]When Jack Kilby began to pursue his idea in July 1958, the founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, Palo Alto, CA were focused on building their first transistors. Even so, in that same month Robert Noyce took time out to document on page 46 of his patent notebook an idea for interconnecting multiple diodes on a single wafer to fabricate an integrated function table. [8] However, as with as the Bell Labs and other approaches, he described a specialized structure that could not be easily adapted for general-purpose designs.Fairchild co-founder Jean Hoerniâ€™s application of the masking and insulating properties of silicon dioxide to implement the planar manufacturing process for transistors revived Noyceâ€™s interest in circuit integration early in 1959. Under the title â€œMethods of isolating multiple devices,â€ on January 23 he wrote on page 70 of his notebook: â€œIn many applications now it would be desirable to make multiple devices on a single piece of silicon in order to be able to make interconnections between the devices as part of the manufacturing process.â€ He noted that the technique could be applied â€œto transistors as well as diodes . . . (to build) a generalized logic elementâ€ and included a schematic for an adder circuit.Jay Last, another Fairchild co-founder, assembled a team of engineers to translate Noyceâ€™s ideas into working devices. They produced the first planar integrated circuit, a 4 transistor, 5 resistor flip-flop in May 1960. [9] Under the trade name ÂµLogic (Micrologic), the company announced the type â€œFâ€ flip-flop function to the public in March 1961. Five additional circuits, including the type â€œGâ€ gate function that served in NASAâ€™s Apollo Guidance Computer, were introduced in October.All major semiconductor manufacturers licensed resulting Fairchild patents and converted their circuit design activities to the planar process that continues to underlie the billion transistor chips of today.Fairchild and TI engaged in litigation over the patents for many years. The courts eventually ruled in Noyceâ€™s favor but by then the companies had settled on a commercial resolution. Kilby and Noyce both received the National Medal of Science in 1979 and today are celebrated as co-inventors of the integrated circuit. As Noyce died in 1990 he was not eligible for the Nobel Prize awarded to Kilby in 2000.As Noyce noted in an IEEE oral history â€œThere is no doubt in my mind that if that invention had not arisen at Fairchild that it would have arisen elsewhere in the very near future. It was an idea whose time had come and the technology had developed to a point where it was viable.â€ [10]This article is based on papers contributed to special issues of the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing devoted to â€œThe Early History of Microcircuitryâ€ published as Volume 34, Number 1 and Volume 35, Number 1 in January 2012 and 2013 respectively.

Read more about the face off and our score categories in the intro blog.Magpi is a great tool for one-time surveys, with a big advantage of being the only tool of the three that works on Apple iOS. It has the best data visualization capabilities which enable users to conduct in-depth analysis, customize their own dashboards, and embed maps. However, even though Magpiâ€™s application builder is very intuitive, we found that it didnâ€™t perform as well when we added logic to our application. We even came across a few bugs and limitations with logic programming, which you encounter along the way through trial and error.User Friendly and Intuitive: Magpiâ€™s user interface is friendly, including the list of question types and options related to the application builder. But if you have a question, there are no apparent direct support channels to guide you. The platform itself is intuitive to use. It has a clear layout that lets you see the basic values and logic in the question frame.Not Enough Support Material: Magpi has a support tab that provides some basic introduction materials, including video tutorials, start guides, and FAQs. It also provides a support forum to help users find answers to more specific questions â€” however, we found that you have to take your time in navigating through all of the topics to find a related solution. We couldnâ€™t find any tutorials to help guide us through our first app building experience, nor any tutorials about more advanced topics. There is a â€œRequest Supportâ€ option where you can write to the developers to find answers, but it is not an immediate solution while youâ€™re in the middle of building the app.No Application Simulator: Magpi does not have a phone simulator. The only way to see your progress is to directly download the App on your phone and test it.Free Version: Magpiâ€™s free version supports most types of questions, although there are restrictions related to using images and signatures. The free version also limits the number of questions and forms in your application, although this shouldnâ€™t be an issue for simple surveys. You can learn more about Magpiâ€™s pricing tiers on their pricing page.Formatting Is Not Too Flexible: You cannot add images, icons, or multimedia to your Magpi application, nor can you format text in label questions. You can display help messages, however, these require special programming on the backend.One-Time Surveys: Magpi is designed to develop one-time surveys and does not allow to link data in different forms. This presents a problem if youâ€™re trying to track specific people or objects of interest over time, since it will require re-inputting data.Easy Programming of Basic Logic: Magpiâ€™s logic user interface is designed for junior developers and people with little technical knowledge. This is done by using a set of â€œifâ€¦ thenâ€¦â€ visual structures organized as a dropdown menu, allowing users to pick from several logic options.Limited Logic Operations: There are several logic limitations in Magpi. For example, you cannot set complex logic involving more than one previous question. Skip logic is not as intuitive because you have to refer to and set parameters in the previous question. Magpi is limited to pre-determined structures for building questions and does not support more advanced logic design. While using dropdown menus to write logic is useful to users with little or no technical experience, it can be limited and time-consuming to more technical users.Mobile Devices: Magpi works with Android, IOS, Symbian, and Java systems.Appearance and Usability: The Magpi app shows all questions in a single screen. Users can scroll through all questions and can answer them in any order. This becomes problematic if you have mandatory questions or questions with logic since any alerts only appear when you are about to submit your survey. We also found that Magpi doesnâ€™t run as smoothly if an application has a lot of logic â€” at times the app freezes or you may even experience an occasional error message.Downloading Data: Magpi has a really easy interface to download your data. The interface is simple and lets you choose what format or type of file you want to use when exporting your data. Some new variables are added to help with future analysis, such as date of register and the user who made the changes.Best Built-In Data Visualization: Magpiâ€™s Reports and Dashboards are great when it comes to visualizing data. They support real-time graphs, charts, and other graphical aids that you can customize to help you see the information in a clear and useful way. Your dashboard can have as many charts and graphs as you need, as well as the possibility of embedding maps, videos, slide-shows, calendars, and more, which can be organized in any layout of your choice.You can download the Magpi Report and Dashboard Guide to learn how to use it. However, it is only available for paid users.Want to see how Magpi stacked up against other data collection tools?Check out our introductory blog, or read our reviews of SurveyCTO and CommCare.Originally published at www.tecsalud.io.----Development and Impact in the Digital WorldFounded in 2017, TecSalud is a tech-agnostic digital development and digital language inclusion company.TecSaludinDevelopment and Impact in the Digital World--TecSaludinDevelopment and Impact in the Digital World--TecSaludinDevelopment and Impact in the Digital World--TecSaludinICT4D LAC--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Scott H.

My personal take is that retail isnâ€™t dying, but bad retail is. Amazon is, after all, a retail company (despite what some traditional brick and mortars may say), and itâ€™s changing the essence of what it means to shop, as well as consumersâ€™ tolerance of what theyâ€™ll accept in a shopping experience.Retail technologies run the gamut, from smart and sophisticated to, â€œwho ever thought that was a good idea?â€ (spoiler alert: someone did). Below Iâ€™ve highlighted some of my favorite technologies in the retail sector and what their futures could hold.Consumersâ€™ appetite for personalized products has been ever growing, and clothing is no exception. Body Labs, an early player in the space, was acquired by Amazon in 2017 for $50-$70M. Co-founded by Bill Oâ€™Farrell, one of my Columbia Business School Professors, the company utilized body scanning technology to make custom-made clothing and other products and services. Now, OnPoint Manufacturing is a leader in the space. The company recently announced the creation of Unique.Fashion, in collaboration with the Fashion Institute of Technology. The company makes custom made, on-demand apparel through its advanced manufacturing and distribution process. This allows for the creation of millions of unique SKUs on-demand, reducing inventory costs and making supply chains increasingly more efficient. Thereâ€™s a big difference between sending your body scan versus personal measurements to a company, and while it remains to be seen how far customers are willing to go to get the perfect fit, this is definitely something thatâ€™s here to stay.2. AI to elevate the luxury experienceItâ€™s no secret that luxury brands are facing stiffer competition than ever before. On the one hand you have a consumer base increasingly valuing sustainability over status, and on the other you have a plethora of digitally native brands (DNBs) reaching your audience faster and cheaper than you are. Enter AI, which has been touted by numerous luxury executives as their secret weapon against the UNIQLOs of the world. Luxury is all about the experience, after all, and no one knows you better than your personal stylist digital assistant. In fact, chat bots and digital assistants are two tools being used to customize luxury customer service. The technology also stores customersâ€™ valuable information to then leverage at a later time. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is also being used to deliver a more authentic chat box experience. Visual search is another favorite of luxury shoppers. Neiman Marcus, for example, teamed up with tech firm Slyce to launch â€˜Snap. Find. Shop.â€™ This app allowed shoppers to upload pictures of cool finds, and then search through Neimanâ€™s catalogue for similar items available for purchase.3. Cyber security on hyperdriveHereâ€™s a scary fact: almost 50% of most organizationsâ€™ IT landscapes are outside the control of their CIOs. As retailers work to expand their body-scanning, custom-making, mind-reading technologies, they also become increasingly exposed to the threat of a cyber attack. Open networks with consumer-owned devices are vulnerable in an entirely new way from closed networkers. Personal shopper data, loyalty program information, payment information and more is growing â€” and making retailers more susceptible at the same time. There are many tactics programmers can employ to ensure those threats remain at bay. Firstly, they should become deeply familiar with the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10. Think of it as a Billboard Top 10 list (but less fun) of most pressing security risks to web applications. For example, a common threat is malicious code being inserted into e-commerce websites. Best practices for developers include practicing â€œgood network hygiene,â€ according to SecurityIntelligence. This includes employing the most recent patches for all hardware, software, network communication protocols and databases, as well as sanitizing user inputs. Think of a patch as taking that 80s jacket with shoulder pads and removing the shoulder pads and adding a heritage print twist (basically updating, fixing or improving the data and processes). Sanitizing user inputs can be thought of as dry cleaning. Sanitizing code ensures that inputs donâ€™t contain malicious code that can be used to mess a site up, ensuring that only clean, safe code is preserved.When I was researching for this article, I thought it was interesting that there werenâ€™t any â€œholy grailâ€ retail cybersecurity technologies. I had imagined plug and play type SaaS software being common in this space, however itâ€™s clear that its really up to individual developers to constantly monitor customer data and inputs. Because at the end of the day, thereâ€™s no better customer service than ensuring your shoppersâ€™ data is being kept just as safe as next seasonâ€™s â€˜itâ€™ color.----Anum Khan--Anum Khan----The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Alex Mathers--220Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Zulie RaneinThe Startup--406HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Letâ€™s check out 3 tips for developing an effective training strategy based on 70 20 10 rule70 20 10 rule holds that 70% of all learning is obtained through work-related experiences, and 20% of learning is obtained from interactions. A person acquires only 10% of his knowledge through formal training.How does this impact your training strategy? Firstly, a lot of people believe that 70 20 10 rule renders formal training as unimportant as a person only gains 10% of knowledge this way.Even though the number seems small, formal learning is very important because it is this 10% that acts as a base for all other types of learning. The better your formal learning, the bigger the chances of you gaining from other types of learning.Keeping this in mind and think about the amount of formal learning you should provide to your learners. The amount of content or the lessons do not need to be exactly 10% of your entire course materials. But make sure that all the major learning concepts are covered in the formal learning segment20% of all the learning happens through interactions. To cover this, make social learning an integral part of your training strategy. Weâ€™ve always seen that people turn to their peers for advice, and trust their friends and colleagues much more than the management.While creating your training strategy make sure that you are using user-generated content effectively. This would make your training more effective and ensure learner engagementPeople learn a lot from work. 70 20 10 rule says that around 70% of all knowledge a person has is obtained through work-related experiences. While creating your training strategy, ensure that you provide ample opportunities for your learners to learn as they work.Provide your learners with quick access to searchable databases, knowledge pools and short courses as they work. While creating your training strategy gives enough importance for effective use of Microlearning.Microlearning is bite-sized learning assets.

This event in all of its grandeur brought together women with various professional and educational backgrounds to contemplate building and transforming the nation. As an attendee, I was moved and humbled to share space with such incredible female builders.Founded in 2018 by award-winning Haitian-American entrepreneur, ShaÃ¯na Silva, the #SHE_BUILDS Global Initiative platform exists to connect women to global opportunities and value chains. Since its founding, #SHE_BUILDS has grown to encompass 20 city chapters across 4 continents. From New York City, to Abidjan, to Montreal, #SHE_BUILDS representatives have organized quarterly events in their respective cities, culminating in the inaugural #SHE_BUILDS_THE FUTURE Festival that struck Port-au-Prince by storm.#SHE_BUILDS_THE FUTURE Festival Panel on Grooming the Next Generation of Creators.The day-long Festival included a series of lightning talks, panels and keynote speeches, all themed around the constructs of building a nation, branding a nation and transforming a nation. Former Prime Minister of Haiti, Michelle Pierre Louis, delivered the opening keynote, transporting us to South Africa and returning to Haiti, urging us all to think deeply about the past and to transcend historical traumas. #SHE_BUILDS Legacy Matriarchs, Danielle Saint Lot and Maryse P. Kedar then set the stage for an afternoon and evening of contemplation.How do you revolutionize Haitiâ€™s agricultural sector? Incorporate technology, urged Genevieve Leveille, CEO and Principal Founder of AgriLedger, a blockchain company that seeks to increase transparency in agricultural supply chains. How do you rebrand a nation? You learn to love what is authentic and indigenous to a place, urged the founder of Pascale Theard Creations when speaking about her use of voodoo symbolism in her artwork. The speakers were numerous and the conversations incredibly rich.Former Prime Minister, Michelle Pierre Louis delivering keynote.What was perhaps the most moving statement of all, was a final call to build solidarity and to establish partnerships in our efforts to build the nation. â€œWhen we build collectively, there is nothing that can stop us,â€ were words echoed by the exceptional Haitian women (and men) who graced the stage.The energy in the room was palpable, as the majority of attendees were young professionals, college students, and entrepreneurs.

Peki, proaktif olmanÄ±n sonuÃ§larÄ±nÄ± neden kurumlarÄ±mÄ±zda gÃ¶remiyoruz?SÃ¼rekli yenilenerek deÄŸiÅŸen ve aÄŸÄ±r rekabetin yaÅŸandÄ±ÄŸÄ± koÅŸullarda; kurumlar faaliyetlerini sÃ¼rdÃ¼rmek, uzun sÃ¼reli ayakta kalabilmek iÃ§in inovatif olmalarÄ± gerektiÄŸini artÄ±k biliyorlar. Bu yÃ¼zden de inovasyonun en Ã¶nemli aktÃ¶rlerinden biri olan insan kaynaÄŸÄ±nÄ±n; sorumluluktan kaÃ§mayan, fÄ±rsat ve tehditleri gÃ¶rebilen, kurum iÃ§in faydalÄ± katkÄ±larÄ± olan, verilen gÃ¶revlerin dÄ±ÅŸÄ±nda sorumluluk ve inisiyatif alabilen kÄ±sacasÄ± proaktif davranÄ±ÅŸ sergileyen Ã§alÄ±ÅŸanlardan oluÅŸmasÄ±nÄ± istiyorlar.Proaktif terimi, â€œpro (Ã¶nce, ileriye yÃ¶nelik)â€ ve â€œactivus (etkin, aktif)â€ sÃ¶zcÃ¼klerinin birleÅŸiminden oluÅŸur. Cambridge sÃ¶zlÃ¼ÄŸÃ¼ndeki tanÄ±ma gÃ¶re; â€œproactiveâ€ kelimesi sÄ±fat olarak â€œzamanÄ±ndan Ã¶nce deÄŸiÅŸiklik yapÄ±larak Ã¶nlem alÄ±nan; Ã¶nceden davranÄ±lanâ€ anlamÄ±na gelir.Proaktif kiÅŸilik Ã¶zelliÄŸine sahip bireyler, Ã§evrelerinde deÄŸiÅŸim gerÃ§ekleÅŸtiren, fÄ±rsatlarÄ± fark eden ve kollayan, inisiyatif alan, harekete geÃ§en, deÄŸiÅŸimin Ã¶ncÃ¼sÃ¼ olan ve diÄŸer Ã§alÄ±ÅŸanlarÄ± sÃ¼rÃ¼kleyen kiÅŸilerdir.Proaktif davranÄ±ÅŸ proaktif kiÅŸilikten kaynaklanÄ±r ve mevcut durumu kendiliÄŸinden deÄŸiÅŸtirecek ya da deÄŸiÅŸtirme niyetiyle baÅŸlatÄ±lmÄ±ÅŸ eylemlerdir. Proaktif davranÄ±ÅŸa sahip Ã§alÄ±ÅŸanlar; geribildirim alma, iÅŸ tanÄ±mÄ±nÄ±n Ã¶tesine geÃ§me, kendisini geliÅŸtirme, inisiyatif kullanma ve mÃ¼ÅŸterilerle yakÄ±ndan ilgilenme gibi proaktif davranÄ±ÅŸlarla meÅŸgul olma eÄŸilimindedirler.Bir Ã§alÄ±ÅŸanÄ±n proaktif kiÅŸilik Ã¶zelliÄŸi taÅŸÄ±masÄ± baÅŸlÄ± baÅŸÄ±na yeterli midir? Proaktiflik davranÄ±ÅŸÄ±nÄ± sergileyebilmek iÃ§in neler gerekir?Kurumun kÃ¼ltÃ¼rÃ¼ Ã§alÄ±ÅŸan davranÄ±ÅŸlarÄ± Ã¼zerinde oldukÃ§a etkilidir. Ã‡alÄ±ÅŸanlar ancak kendilerine alan yaratÄ±ldÄ±ÄŸÄ±nda ve motive edildiklerinde proaktif davranabilirler. Buna da psikolojik gÃ¼Ã§lendirme denir.Psikolojik gÃ¼Ã§lendirme, arttÄ±rÄ±lmÄ±ÅŸ iÃ§sel motivasyon demektir. Psikolojik gÃ¼Ã§lendirme anlam, yetkinlik, Ã¶zerklik ve etki olmak Ã¼zere dÃ¶rt biliÅŸsel Ã¶ÄŸe tarafÄ±ndan aÃ§Ä±klanan bir motivasyonel yapÄ± olarak ifade edilmiÅŸtir.Anlam: KiÅŸinin yaptÄ±ÄŸÄ± iÅŸten algÄ±ladÄ±ÄŸÄ± Ã¶nemdir. KiÅŸi, yaptÄ±ÄŸÄ± iÅŸin Ã¶nemli olduÄŸunu dÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼nmelidir.Yetkinlik: KiÅŸi, Ã¶z yeterliliÄŸi ya da yapmÄ±ÅŸ olduÄŸu gÃ¶revi baÅŸarÄ±lÄ± bir ÅŸekilde tamamlayacaÄŸÄ±na inanmalÄ±dÄ±r.Ã–zerklik: KiÅŸi, iÅŸleri nasÄ±l baÅŸlatÄ±p ne ÅŸekilde sÃ¼rdÃ¼receÄŸine iliÅŸkin seÃ§im yapma Ã¶zgÃ¼rlÃ¼ÄŸÃ¼ne sahip olmalÄ±dÄ±r.Etki: KiÅŸi, davranÄ±ÅŸlarÄ±yla stratejik, yÃ¶netsel ya da iÅŸlemsel iÅŸ Ã§Ä±ktÄ±larÄ±nda fark yaratabileceÄŸini dÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼nmelidir.Yani, Ã§alÄ±ÅŸan desteklendiÄŸini ve kurumunda deÄŸerli olduÄŸunu hissederse, yaptÄ±ÄŸÄ± iÅŸlerin Ã§Ä±ktÄ±larÄ±nÄ±n kurumu tarafÄ±ndan kullanÄ±ldÄ±ÄŸÄ±nÄ± bilirse proaktif davranÄ±ÅŸ sergiler. Proaktif davranÄ±ÅŸ sergileyen Ã§alÄ±ÅŸan, kurumdaki inovasyon kÃ¼ltÃ¼rÃ¼nÃ¼n oluÅŸmasÄ±nda bÃ¼yÃ¼k rol oynayacaktÄ±r.Bu Ã§erÃ§evede ele alÄ±nÄ±nca, kurumlarÄ±n mesleki ve teknik Anadolu lisesinden mezun Ã§alÄ±ÅŸanlarÄ±nÄ±n proaktif olmalarÄ±nÄ±n Ã¶nÃ¼ndeki engelleri kaldÄ±rmalarÄ± gerektiÄŸi Ã§ok aÃ§Ä±k.Mesleki ve teknik Anadolu liseleri, geÃ§miÅŸte talihsiz bir ÅŸekilde ikinci plana atÄ±ldÄ±. Meslek Ã¶ÄŸreten kurum statÃ¼sÃ¼, â€œpuanÄ±mÄ±n yettiÄŸi okulâ€ statÃ¼sÃ¼ne dÃ¶nÃ¼ÅŸtÃ¼. Toplumun gÃ¶zÃ¼nde baÅŸarÄ±sÄ±z ve isteksiz Ã¶ÄŸrenciler bu okullara gidiyor. Pygmalion teorisine gÃ¶re, kiÅŸiler bir sÃ¼re sonra baÅŸkalarÄ±nÄ±n kendinden beklenene denk dÃ¼ÅŸen davranÄ±ÅŸlar sergiler. Ä°ÅŸte tam da bu teoriyi doÄŸrular ÅŸekilde, gÃ¼nÃ¼mÃ¼zde mesleki ve teknik Anadolu lisesi Ã¶ÄŸrencilerine ve mezunlarÄ±na yÃ¶nelik bu yargÄ±lar, onlarÄ±n geliÅŸmelerine, kendilerine gÃ¼venmelerine, yaratÄ±cÄ±-yenilikÃ§i olmalarÄ±na ve en nihayetinde teknik bilgileri sayesinde kurumlardaki birÃ§ok soruna Ã§Ã¶zÃ¼m bulabilecekken, inovasyon sÃ¼reÃ§lerine dÃ¢hil edilmelerine engel oluyor.TÃ¼rkiyeâ€™de inovasyon deyince akÄ±llara mesleki ve teknik Anadolu liseleri gelmiyor Ã§Ã¼nkÃ¼ sistematik olarak bir gÃ¼ven sorunu ile karÅŸÄ±laÅŸÄ±yorlar. Ancak, meslek lisesi Ã¶ÄŸrencilerinin ve mezunlarÄ±nÄ±n yenilikÃ§i olmasÄ±na Ã¶n yargÄ±larÄ±mÄ±z haricinde hiÃ§bir engel bulunmuyor.Sahada, bu Ã¶nyargÄ±larÄ±n aÅŸÄ±lmasÄ± iÃ§in birÃ§ok STK ve kurum Ã§alÄ±ÅŸÄ±yor. MESS EÄŸitim VakfÄ±, Kodluyoruz.org ve Ã–zel SektÃ¶r GÃ¶nÃ¼llÃ¼leri DerneÄŸi gibi STKâ€™lar meslek lisesi Ã¶ÄŸrencilerinin hem kiÅŸisel hem de biliÅŸsel aÃ§Ä±dan geliÅŸimlerini desteklemek iÃ§in projeler yÃ¼rÃ¼tÃ¼yor. AyrÄ±ca ArÃ§elik, TÃ¼rk TraktÃ¶r, BorÃ§elik ve BSH gibi kurumlar da yaptÄ±klarÄ± sosyal sorumluluk projeleri ile Ã¶ÄŸrencilerin yetkinliklerini arttÄ±rmayÄ± hedefliyor. TÃ¼m bu projeler ile Ã¶ÄŸrenciler hem kendilerini daha iyi ifade etmeyi Ã¶ÄŸreniyor, hem de alanlarÄ±nda daha yetkin hale geliyor.Ã–ÄŸrencileri gÃ¼Ã§lendirmek iÃ§in hep bir elden Ã§alÄ±ÅŸÄ±yoruz. Peki, mezun olup iÅŸe baÅŸladÄ±klarÄ±nda, gÃ¼Ã§lendirme ve destekleme sÃ¼reci devam ediyor mu? Kurumlar, mesleki ve teknik Anadolu liseleri mezunu Ã§alÄ±ÅŸanlarÄ±na problemleri tespit etmeleri, yeni fikirler Ã¼retmeleri ve bu fikirlerini dile getirmeleri iÃ§in motive ediyor mu veya onlar iÃ§in alan yaratÄ±yor mu?

577,16775,https://medium.com/@cssemlerolero/m%C3%A9tricas-de-customer-success-df9669185c2a?source=tag_archive---------81-----------------------,MÃ©tricas de Customer Success,None,CS Sem Lero Lero,https://medium.com/@cssemlerolero,5,8,0,"CS Sem Lero LeroFollow--2SharePara explicar as mÃ©tricas de forma didÃ¡tica vamos criar uma empresa fictÃ­cia e chama-la de Hotel Soft, um software de gestÃ£o hoteleira. Atualmente a Hotel Soft possui 400 clientes pagantes e seu ticket mÃ©dio Ã© de R$ 250,00 por mÃªs.1# ChurnClientes que cancelam o seu produto/serviÃ§o.Logo Churn: Ã‰ o nÃºmero de clientes que cancelaram. Vamos considerar que neste mÃªs a Hotel Soft teve 15 cancelamentos.Churn Rate: Ã‰ a taxa de cancelamento. Sabendo que tivemos 15 cancelamentos e no inicio do mÃªs estÃ¡vamos com 400 clientes. O nosso Churn Rate Ã© 3,75% (15 dividido por 400). Isto quer dizer que a Hotel Soft perdeu 3,75% dos seus clientes.Revenue Churn: Ã‰ o valor total em moeda que perdemos com os 15 clientes que cancelaram. No nosso exemplo vamos considerar que estes clientes representam uma perda de R$ 4.000,00 por mÃªs.Revenue Churn Rate: Ã‰ a taxa de cancelamento em dinheiro. No inÃ­cio do mÃªs os 400 clientes pagantes somavam um MRR (Receita Recorrente Mensal) de R$ 100.000,00. Para calcular devemos dividir R$ 4.000,00 por R$ 100.000,00 e entÃ£o o nosso Revenue Churn Rate serÃ¡ de 4%Talvez vocÃª ache que perder 4% da base de clientes seja um resultado aceitÃ¡vel, afinal os outros 96% ainda sÃ£o seus clientes. Mas vocÃª jÃ¡ parou para pensar sobre o impacto disso? No nosso exemplo a Hotel Soft perdeu R$ 4.000,00 em apenas um mÃªs, e este valor poderia ser usado para pagar o salÃ¡rio de dois funcionÃ¡rios. E no mÃªs seguinte quanto vai ser o Churn? 4% de novo? Por isso Ã© muito importante acompanhar o Churn Acumulativo.PoderÃ­amos bater no peito e dizer: â€œSomos fodas, 96% da base continua com a genteâ€. NÃ£o se iluda! Isso Ã© uma mÃ©trica de vaidade . No primeiro mÃªs o Churn pode parecer inofensivo, mas a longo prazo vira uma bola de neve e vai causar um avalanche no seu negÃ³cio. Nos posts futuros vamos falar sobre o que fazer quando o cliente pede cancelamento.2# AtivaÃ§Ã£oÃ‰ o momento em que consideramos que o cliente alcanÃ§ou o primeiro marco de sucesso com o seu produto/serviÃ§o.Na Hotel Soft poderÃ­amos definir os seguintes critÃ©rios para ativaÃ§Ã£o (SLA) por exemplo:â€¢ Cadastro de pelo menos 20 clientes;â€¢ Efetuar 10 reservas;â€¢ Realizar 5 check-ins; eâ€¢ Realizar 5 check-outsâ€(Vamos falar sobre como definir os critÃ©rios de ativaÃ§Ã£o em outro post)Estes critÃ©rios quando cumpridos devem mostrar que o seu cliente alcanÃ§ou o First Value e estÃ¡ pronto para tirar as rodinhas da bike e se aventurar por aÃ­ .EntÃ£o qual Ã© a taxa de clientes que tiraram as rodinhas?Ã‰ sÃ³ vocÃª calcular o nÃºmero de clientes que cumpriram a SLA e dividir pelo total de clientes do mesmo perÃ­odo. Este mÃªs a Hotel Soft tem 40 novos clientes e 30 ativaram, entÃ£o a taxa de ativaÃ§Ã£o deste lote Ã© de 75% (30 dividido por 40).VocÃª tambÃ©m pode calcular usando a sua base total de clientes. Na Hotel Soft temos 260 clientes ativados, ou seja, 65% da base legada estÃ¡ ativada (260 divido por 400).Ã‰ importante analisar se os critÃ©rios definidos realmente fazem sentido, mas nÃ£o vamos nos preocupar com isso agora. Fica tranquilo que em breve falaremos sobre como validar os critÃ©rios de ativaÃ§Ã£o.3# NPSO Net Promoter Score (NPS) Ã© uma pesquisa que possui a finalidade de mensurar o grau de indicaÃ§Ã£o do seu produto/serviÃ§o Ã  outras pessoas.VocÃª pode aplicar em qualquer tipo de organizaÃ§Ã£o. Na Hotel Soft podemos fazer assim:â€œ Em uma escala de 0 a 10, o quÃ£o vocÃª indicaria a Hotel Soft para seus amigos ou colegas?â€Se o cliente responder de 0 a 6 ele Ã© detrator, ou seja, ele nÃ£o gosta de vocÃª e ainda faz questÃ£o de dizer isso para outras pessoas.Entre 7 e 8 ele Ã© neutro, Ã© o famoso em cima do muro. Se o seu concorrente falar com ele e for melhor do que vocÃª, a chance de cancelar Ã© grande.Os promotores sÃ£o os clientes que avaliam em 9 e 10, e isso deve ser comemorado. Esses clientes provavelmente te amam e o melhor disso, vÃ£o fazer marketing para vocÃª.Independente da nota que o cliente dÃ¡, Ã© importante vocÃª entender o motivo. Afinal vocÃª precisa saber quais sÃ£o os seus pontos fortes e fracos. PorÃ©m, todavia, entretanto, na prÃ¡tica a maioria das empresas sÃ³ conversam com os detratores. Deveria ser assim? NÃ£o! Mas a realidade Ã© sempre diferente. Como queremos evitar o churn, Ã© natural que a gente dÃª mais atenÃ§Ã£o para os detratores.Para calcular o NPS existe uma fÃ³rmula, mas acho que nÃ£o faz sentido vocÃªs calcularem isso na mÃ£o, por isso vou apresentar para vocÃªs estÃ¡ calculadora online que achei na internet.Geralmente as notas sÃ£o coletadas destas formas:NÃ£o recomendo vocÃª fazer essa pergunta cara a cara com o seu cliente, pode ser que ele se sinta constrangido em ter que te responder. (Mas se for a Ãºnica opÃ§Ã£o, faÃ§a, Ã© melhor do que nada).4# ExpansionÃ‰ quando o seu cliente te paga mais.Upsell/Upgrade: Seu cliente migra para um plano mais caro.Na Hotel Soft temos dois planos. O Basic que tem um valor de R$ 100,00 por mÃªs e Ã© mais indicado para hotÃ©is de pequeno porte. JÃ¡ o plano Business tem um valor de R$ 300,00 e Ã© mais indicado para hotÃ©is de grande porte.EntÃ£o quando o cliente migra para um plano mais caro, significa que ele estÃ¡ crescendo. Ele estÃ¡ oferecendo um serviÃ§o de mais qualidade aos hÃ³spedes pois o software atende suas necessidades e melhora sua produtividade.Crossell: SÃ£o vendas adicionais fora do plano. Na Hotel Soft podemos oferecer curso de camareira, curso de recepcionista, vender mais espaÃ§os para armazenamento de dados, pacote de e-mails para enviar aos hÃ³spedes e etc.EntÃ£o a venda destes serviÃ§os adicionais tambÃ©m indicam que o nosso produto/serviÃ§o Ã© importante para o cliente, pois ele esta usando mais recursos que disponibilizamos e profissionalizando seus colaboradores.Alguns dados importantes para o cÃ¡lculo do Expansion Rate:FÃ³rmula:[(MRRfm â€” NMRR)/(MRRim â€” RC)]-1Receitinha de bolo agora galera:EntÃ£o podemos concluir que o MRR dos clientes que iniciaram no mÃªs e nÃ£o cancelaram, teve um aumento de 2% de receita.5# Lifetime e Lifetime Value (LTV)Ã‰ o quanto de dinheiro um cliente deixa na sua empresa durante o perÃ­odo de relacionamento. Na Hotel Soft temos um cliente que paga R$ 300,00 por mÃªs e ele jÃ¡ estÃ¡ usando o nosso produto hÃ¡ 12 meses. Portanto o seu LTV Ã© de R$ 3.600,00. PorÃ©m este cÃ¡lculo estÃ¡ vinculado a apenas um cliente, o ideal Ã© fazermos um mÃ©dia para sabermos o LTV de todos os clientes. Vamos considerar entÃ£o que os clientes da Hotel Soft costumam ficar durante 8 meses (Lifetime).Portando devemos realizar o seguinte cÃ¡lculo:Ticket MÃ©dio X Lifetime = Lifetime ValueR$ 250,00 x 8 = R$ 2.000,00 (LTV)O LTV Ã© uma mÃ©trica muito estratÃ©gica e importante para o planejamento e crescimento da sua organizaÃ§Ã£o. Ele Ã© muito utilizado para comparar com o CAC, que Ã© uma mÃ©trica muito utilizada no marketing e vendas para saber quanto custa trazer um novo cliente.Este post Ã© introdutÃ³rio e vocÃª pode consulta-lo sempre que necessÃ¡rio.

It created a lot of hype and panic as it showed something which was only seen in science fiction movies. Please have a look. Donâ€™t miss the last 20 seconds.This video was shared millions of times but without the word Parody in the caption. Which meant the people who believe without checking the authenticity of source panicked and it lead to the huge outburst.But thankfully it was fake. The video was created using CGI and green screen technology.But who knows Reinforcement Learning can really produce these results?Being a person closely following the advancements in this field I am sure that the day when this really happens is not far. When I was a kid I was easily able to defeat the computer in the game of chess but now the computer can defeat champion chess players.www.theguardian.comHumans created Atom Bombs, Nuclear weapons in the name of security and research. But when they were misused the very nations responsible for starting the research for weapons started drafting rules to stop further manufacture of these lethal weapons. Partly because they do not want others to become a threat to their hegemony on the High Table.But that didnâ€™t stop the ever-increasing growth of these weapons.The Batch and Forbes published these articles. The titles are enough to suggest what message they want to spread.info.deeplearning.aiwww.forbes.comSo, now countries want robots and machines to automatically deal with threats. This seems nice. Wow! Eureka! Soldiers will not have to lay their lives.But nothing is ideal and no AI model achieves 100 % accuracy (As per my knowledge which I am 91.2 % sure is correct).So what if the model predicted someone as a threat and dealt with it. Then what? Who will be responsible? The robot canâ€™t be punished, neither the scientists. As they are just the researchers who make things without thinking about the ill effects they can have.People argue that if we do not make things then someone else will. This very argument has caused the doom of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Everyone has a hunger for something. For people of science, this hunger is discovery. But discovering electricity is one thing and discovering lethal bombs is way another. One is for the greater good and the other is just to increase the death toll.I do not know why people canâ€™t see the ultimate result of what we are developing. Someone created Deep Fake. I will leave the task of thinking about the ill effects of Deep Fake to you. Just for the starters: Deep Fake shook Facebook so much that it is willing to spend millions to detect it. Why stop something after it has happened? Creating rules to cap the nuclear weapon creation, creating competition to detect deep fake and one day creating rules to stop the manufacture of AI weapons!What is this AI? It stands for Artificial intelligence. By it what we mean is that we are trying to create something which can think on its own.We are thinking that it will help us with daily tasks. Or in tasks that are very hazardous for humans and should be dealt with by robots only. But what if they become smart enough to think on their own? What if the video, in the beginning, was real? After all, this is the meaning of Intelligence: thinking on your own.What if they do not obey you? What if they do not like you? We all have watched these scenes in Hollywood movies. What if they really happen?I have this simple theory: We created bombs to explode. We never created them to explode on their own. But once we throw them or start them they will do what they are made for: Explode. We canâ€™t stop them once they are started. I am sure you know where I am going with this theory: We are creating AI to think.I may be naive as I am comparatively new in this world. So I ask you this: do you think this way? And if yes then why are we going towards our doom? And if no please correct me with some reasonable arguments.This is my first article on Medium. Thanks for reading.

There are many firms working on products, services, projects, investment products, and initiatives that seek to develop, commercialize, and advance the state of staking. As I was reflecting on all of the firms and projects who have entered the fray in the last six months, I was impressed by rapid growth of the staking ecosystem.Given the rapid evolution of â€œstaking,â€ we brought together a small-ish group of stakeholders (no pun intended) on Monday, March 18 to have an open conversation about how we can collaborate on best practices, data sharing, and education & advocacy efforts.The purpose of this post is to share some of the topics we discussed as a group, the next steps weâ€™re working on, and to provide a forum for all participants in this new market to collaborate, communicate, and share data.We hope this is one of the many catalysts that drives more events, research, and collaboration, and spurs more digital and physical communities to develop as the topic of staking grows and evolves.At the time of writing (March 26, 2019), there are 11 Proof of Stake protocols with a network value of over $100M that deploy a staking function of some sort â€” including masternodes. These protocols have a collective network value of nearly $9 billion, and an average staking rewards of roughly 5% per year. This means the staking market currently represents at least $450M in annual staking rewards.There are also several multi-billion dollar networks, including Binanceâ€™s BNB token and Cardano, that are about to shift to Proof of Stake, and numerous networks in the process of launching that will deploy Proof of Stake. Tentatively, these networks have a value of at least $8 billion, using conservative estimates of value on launch. If we apply the same 5% network reward rate, we can expect this market to be roughly $400M per annum. Conservative estimates indicate staking could be a billion dollar market as early as mid-2019. As one might imagine, the competitive landscape for products, services, and investment vehicles capitalizing on the relatively low-risk strategy of staking is heating up!As I often to like to ask, but why. Why is staking becoming a topic? Well, investors are fiduciaries, and if they are long an asset (ie plan to hold it for a while), they should be earning inflation to preserve their pro-rata share of the network. Most funds do not yet have the capacity and likely wonâ€™t have the desire to do everything themselves. Individual investors also do not have the capacity to learn, track, and participate in all of the elaborate ritual associated with staking across numerous protocols.My own research has taken longer than expected because of the challenges in gathering reliable data and doing basic research. Even understanding just how each protocol works is a serious time commitment! From a service provider perspective, there is not yet an entity that provides services to every network, and there may not be over the long term either. Not all networks are built the same, and they require expertise â€” no one entity can be a master in all protocols.There are a large number of stakeholders who are impacted by the evolution of the staking ecosystem, and will have a vested interest in shaping outcomes. Some of these participants are more passive, and some are more active. However, all will play a critical role in the future of staking, and should be a part of the conversation. The below diagram attempts to detail some of the key participants in the staking ecosystem today.The Summit represented stakeholders from these diverse groups, and we believe that the future of building a functional staking ecosystem will depend on continued collaboration and communication between these parties.Initial conversations were organized around a few key themes, including:Ultimately, the group prioritized four key topics, which are detailed below with points from the conversation, and ideas on how to take these conversations forward in a more focused manner.We discussed the various design parameters of investment products and strategies including legacy finance analogs such as reverse repos, derivatives, and debt products. A big theme was how to manage volatility and staking rewards, track liquidity and volatility of the underlying staked assets, whether fixed or floating reward rates should be used, and how prediction markets, synthetic derivatives, and other hedging strategies could be combined with staking strategies to provide investors with more desirable products.One of the key areas for continued exploration was emulating master limited partnerships or other tax advantaged vehicles where expenses and amortization could be passed through to investors in a tax advantaged way, especially to finance hardware and other capital investments, as well as how to effectively calculate, manage, and treat the rewards accrued â€” whether there should be physical delivery of coins or synthetic delivery via a second instrument, if rewards should be compounding or cashed out periodically, whether rewards should be paid in like kind or in fiat, and determining cost basis for tax purposes.There were a number of issues noted around how scalable staking strategies might be, given the relatively small size of the market and the lack of market depth in some of these assets when liquidating for cash or bitcoin. We also discussed the governance implications of staking as an investment strategy, how one might determine who owns the underlying rights associated with the network, and how a secondary market for voting / governance rights might be needed, or some sort of STRIP like instrument that separates the act of securing the network in return for inflation rewards and participating in governance.Next Steps â€” The group agreed that an investment products sub-group would be helpful, and that this group could focus on research, legal and tax approaches, and coordination in provisioning and management of liquidity to minimize the impact of staking products on the integrity of the market for these underlying assets (if such a thing exists). More importantly, the group agreed that people who donâ€™t yet own crypto may find staking vehicles more familiar for investment, as the reward resembles a stock dividend or a yield-bearing asset, and displays a unique risk â€” reward profile.There is clearly a whole new legal and regulatory landscape that needs to be explored in this new world. One key message was that all participants firmly felt coordinated engagement with regulators would be in the best interests of the staking community. This includes advocacy efforts and the creation of templates, tools, and standards, including regulation, tax, control matters, and disclosures standards.There was a long discussion on the tax implications of staking, and whether this is dividend income, passive income, savings income, or 1099-MISC income â€” or something else altogether! On the tax side, the determination of fair market value is a thorny matter given the challenge of tracking price with a reliable market oracle, as most times the market price on CoinMarketCap does not reflect the price at which positions in size can be bought or sold, and perhaps using rules from the Pink Sheets / OTC markets on pricing could be helpful here.One additional idea was the creation of something like LIBOR, where a rate-setting mechanism is created by some of the industry participants including exchanges and OTC desks. All attendees felt there was a lot to collaborate on in the tax space, as when tax regulators from around the world begin to oversee this space more closely, they will likely use existing guidance from firms in the space. Therefore, setting a well-researched, supported precedent is important.Next Steps â€” A few firms have already begun writing memos and working towards more clarity on staking in the US market in particular. These firms agreed to share these templates, and the participants are actively working on a public repository for these documents. Furthermore, a few firms agreed to take the lead on engaging leading professional services firms to explore publishing some primers and initial opinion pieces to help grow the domain.The next dialogue around economic structures and network incentives was an interesting one. The core of this conversation was the principal / agent problem, as described by Coase in the theory of the firm and expounded on throughout the last 100 years of behavioral economics â€” what happens in instances where agents (service providers or protocol teams) have an interest that conflicts with that of principals (investors)? Examples include rate fixing and cartel behavior, a phenomenon I personally have been fascinated by and written about at length, the creation of a secondary market for selling voting rights and thereby creating a separate market for governance, and the issue of free riders and using token economics to reward people who submit protocol upgrades.One core theme was the topic of larger players, especially custodial players, dominating the market. We discussed strategies to incentivize smaller validators and staking services to stay in the market, and ways to encourage less â€œcentralizationâ€ â€” perhaps through a progressive tax of sorts where larger players would earn lower yields or subsidize smaller players. There is also a clear need for better data and research around the efficacy, cost, and risk of using staking as a network maintenance mechanism.We also talked about the design of staking systems, and how reward maximization and services that engage in dynamic staking reward optimization could adversely impact security on networks. It was agreed that to maintain competitive dynamics, switching between service providers should be as easy as possible, and that exchanges could be the largest threat to staking by serving as centralized aggregation points for tokens. There was discussion about unnamed exchanges taking clientsâ€™ staking rewards and selling them for their own gain, and the need for greater transparency.Next Steps â€” There were some existential questions about the future of staking, and agreement that exchanges and other aggregation points where coins are held need to be more transparent staking relationships and providing options to their users. Some participants started working on a â€œbuyer bewareâ€ post to help educate users, and there was discussion of creating a staking â€œcode of ethicsâ€ to drive some agreement around transparency and disclosure standards. Protocol teams expressed an interest in more collaborative research, data sharing, and dialogue between themselves and the staking community to help drive better design principles for protocols, networks, and governance mechanisms.Lastly, the theme of language and terminology was a consistent challenge throughout the conversation. It is difficult to distinguish the different types of staking, and explain the unique nuances of each protocol. We need more specific language to describe the various methods for staking and distinguish work / staking to secure the network from governance, and the relationship between technical consensus, social consensus, and financial reward via network inflation rates or token depreciation in the form of slashing. Not everything should be made equal across protocols but common understanding would be helpful.The group had concerns about using terms like yield, interest, or other financial terminology that could conflate the act of staking with regulated activities, or create confusion around the risks associated with staking. There was also a brief discussion around sharia compliant activities and how to explain staking in the context of islamic finance.Next Steps â€” The group agreed to share Staking 101 documents and identify ways to standardize common terminology and definitions. The goal of these efforts is not to commoditize language, but to create more consistency in how staking is explained.We realize much of the discussion was exploratory in nature, and one of the reasons we focused on the discussion in priority order is because many of the topics are interesting but not yet at a point where they are actionable.As a starting point, we want to create an initial directory and â€œstaking ecosystem mapâ€ of protocols, service providers, projects, funds, and efforts in the staking space that we can share publicly and encourage folks to add to as the space grows.If youâ€™re involved in staking in any way, shape, or form, please add your firm here!Weâ€™ll post this list publicly, along with other resources, in the coming weeks, and hope to continue publishing data and research around staking in one (somewhat) consolidated place.This was a smaller group discussion, as the upper limit on attendees was the space available in the CoinShares office. We will repeat a summit of some sort every quarter, and organize for a larger day-long conference later this year.Lastly, this group is working on a more comprehensive industry effort around advocacy, education, and standards, which will be launched in the coming weeks. If you are interested in being involved, supporting, or learning more, please contact me, Jason Stone from Battlestar Capital, or Santiago Roel Santos from EON Capital.We are excited to see the staking ecosystem grow and evolve!A sincere thanks to everyone who was able to participate, whether directly or by submitting their comments in advance.----15making benevolent mischief. investing @coinshares.Meltem Demirors--2Meltem DemirorsinCoinShares Blog--1Meltem Demirors--Meltem DemirorsinLeaders Series--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Linda CarollinThe Partnered Pen--167Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639PanterainThe Crypto Kiosk--48Jayden LevittinLevel Up Coding--38HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

People management is certainly one of the career paths, but successful tech companies like Amazon & Google show that there are many other significant development opportunities for software engineers without taking on people management responsibility.Certainly, companies with hundreds or even thousands of engineers have other requirements and can offer roles that are irrelevant in smaller companies with only 5 to 50 engineers. In this article, I want to outline roles that can be relevant also in smaller teams depending on the type and industry of the company.Investing in the career development of software engineers has many positives:Here are a few categories of roles that software engineers can develop into â€” most companies will probably find multiple of them being relevant for their teams.Software engineers with this career path strive to become an expert in one particular area â€” this might be a specific technology, e.g. some database technology, but it could also be the technical aspects of complex topics like payments.Topic experts can save the company a lot of time and money just by being an in-house consultant to various tech or business teams. Of course, it is important that the technology or topic is one of the critical areas in the company and should not be an afterthought.Key capabilities:A product that is continuously under development becomes more and more complex and in many cases, tech debt is slowly growing over time. System architects can plan and implement the required service structure for green-field projects as well as projects that need to overcome legacy systems to make the team more productive.Key capabilities:In many companies, there are always new project ideas that need to be validated. Are users interested in this product? Do they like our solution? In addition to being able to create compelling prototypes in record time, prototyperâ€™s ability to figure out how to produce an MVP (minimum viable product) can also create a lot of value for teams improving on existing products as well.Key skills:Most engineers see the world from a different perspective than many others in the organization. Having developers that are excited about user experience and business value is a huge resource to product owners and other business teams. They open up feature & product ideas that somebody without a tech background may not have thought about.Key skills:I have seen many successful software engineers grow out of their roles and jump over to the agile or product-management world. Teaching others about agile work and diving even deeper into agile methodology can be an interesting endeavor â€” but itâ€™s quite a bit step from the original starting point.Key skills:At last: People managers are responsible for ensuring happiness, productivity as well as long term growth of each of their respective employees. This, of course, canâ€™t be left out as a career development option, but I donâ€™t consider it the most obvious one, given the typical skill set of an engineer.Key skills:I believe itâ€™s super important that you genuinely care about the problems each particular role is solving and the company that youâ€™re working for needs to see the value in having that role. I canâ€™t imagine a company with more than 10 software engineers, which does not at least need 2â€“3 of the roles listed above!Every company has a different salary policy â€” in comparison to individual contributor roles, it is important to note that each of the roles above is spending significant time enabling other people and therefore paying them according to how they can help make other team members more productive sounds fair to me.----VP Product @ Limehome â€” Numbers driven, moving fast and breaking things.

MIT professors David Autor, Andrew McAfee, and Erik Brynjolfsson explain how automation will not be able to fully substitute humans as they will still be necessary as well as providing possible policy change.David Autor is an economics professor at MIT, focusing his research on topics from labor economics. Autor breaks down the effects of automation vs labor into 3 factors (Autor 7):1. Workers are more likely to benefit from automation if they supply jobs that are complemented by it. For example, an atm can substitute a bank teller but cannot provide the â€œrelationship bankingâ€ a bank teller provides.2. If the complementary tasks supplied become abundant in the economy, it is plausible a flood of new workers could compromise wage gains that would stem from the complementary relationship of automation and labor input.3. The output elasticity of demand combined with income elasticity can either positively or negatively impact the gains from automation. In the example of agriculture, productivity improvements from technology is accompanied by declines in the share of household income spent on food. Health care is another example, improvements in technology have led to larger shares of income being spent on health.When utilized correctly, automation can still provide an opportunity for laborers to find work due for the need of complementary tasks. But Autor also touches on the subject of â€œsubstitutionâ€. As the price of computing power has fallen, computers and robots have displaced workers in routine tasks (Autor 11). Routine tasks are susceptible to automation due to the fact that they can be fully codified to follow precise procedures and performed by machines. This can lead to a decline in clerical and administrative support jobs as well those in the production industry. This reasoning implies that computerization of routine job tasks may lead to â€œjob polarizationâ€ (Autor 12). This means there will be growth of both high-education/high-wage jobs and low-education/low-wage but at the expense of the middle class demographic.Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson, faculty members at the MIT Sloan School of Management, have studied the impact of technology on economies for years. They have been grappling the dilemma of why digital innovations are contributing to the stagnation in average incomes in the United States and to the disappearance of so many middle-level jobs. McAfee and Brynjolfsson both predict low-wage jobs will be the first to be at risk due to the digitization of labor. A 2016 U.S. Council of Economic Advisers estimated that 83 percent of jobs paying less than $20/hour could be automated (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 140). Because of this, McAfee and Brynjolfsson emphasize the need for new policies to protect workers and give them a chance to keep up as technology continues to speed up the workforce. As technology races ahead, there will be opportunities to relevel the field in which businesses compete. A much more encouraging development is President Barack Obamaâ€™s Open Government Initiative. In 2013, Obama signed an executive order making open and machine-readable data â€œthe new default for government information.â€ (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 143). At all levels of the government, the United States needs more such efforts, which would prove helpful to all sorts of decision-makers. As more and more digital data become available, there will be even more opportunities for sharing information to improve policy, and McAfee and Brynjolfsson believe the government should play a key role in this process.Works CitedAutor, David H. â€œWhy Are There Still So Many Jobs?

This can take years, or even decades to occur, depending on the sophistication of the solution, and how easily it fits into an existing application to add value in a broad set of use cases.The most obvious examples are on the smartphone where we have long ago (in tech years) absorbed our digital cameras and GPS devices, and perhaps more subtly, photo editing software and directory services.Email encryption has been an adjunct service and solution that overlays and complements most email services and UIs, Microsoft Exchange and Outlook as prime examples. Virtually all email encryption solutions work with the Microsoft email server and client, even as it migrated to the cloud as part of Office 365. Microsoft introduced its own email encryption solution, Office Message Encryption, as an option and integrated feature of Office 365 in 2014. It has been improved since introduction, and while it still has some limitations (link to Osterman webinar), for many users that need an ad hoc solution for HR and legal departments â€” it is quite sufficient, and eliminates the need for a specialty vendor (DataMotion included). While itâ€™s not without cost, it is appealing to organizations seeking to reduce the number of 3rd party solutions and vendors in their IT mix.Also, in the cloud email service provider space, Gmail has implemented a widely enabled encryption technique as a default (TLS), and in so doing, provides opportunistic security for all email traffic originating from their service. While it doesnâ€™t assure compliance, it does take a significant step towards â€˜email encryption as a standard featureâ€™ vs an overlaid 3rd party solution.As noted â€” most email encryption solutions already integrated very well with Outlook and Exchange, which in effect make them a plug-in toolbar button feature of Outlook, invoked with a click. So it has already been reduced to a feature of email in this way for most ad hoc, desktop requirements. Yet, the use of email for messaging and file exchange is not always a desktop ad hoc function.In fact â€” where it matters most â€” in high volume business processes handling regulated information, Outlook (or any webmail interface for that matter), is not the best place to send and receive messages and files. CRMs, contact centers, practice management software, electronic health record systems, and custom database applications are the applications that often house the data and track the interactions with customers, partners (or patients). Shouldnâ€™t email encryption be a standard feature of those solutions? And for situations where the customer, client or patient need to initiate an inquiry â€” shouldnâ€™t a secure email channel be a feature easily accessible to them too through customer facing interfaces and apps such as websites, portals and mobile apps?While email encryption vendors can extend the existing Outlook style â€˜plug-inâ€™ model of creating applets to expose their email encryption service as a â€˜toolbar buttonâ€™ in popular CRM UIâ€™s (Salesforce for instance) â€” this approach doesnâ€™t scale well, and doesnâ€™t always accommodate the use case at hand, or fit into customer facing services such as self-service portals or mobile apps. In these cases, a native solution is best, using web service email encryption APIs to provide secure messaging, file and form exchange to support high volume applications with trusted security and verifiable compliance.This application of email encryption APIs lends itself best to healthcare, financial services, insurance and government applications, at enterprise scale. These organizations are best positioned to migrate off standalone email encryption solutions, and leverage the benefits of email encryption as a feature thru the use of APIs.While enterprise class organizations have the resources and transaction volumes to leverage APIs for integrating email encryption as a feature into their workflow process and enterprise apps, broader market benefits are derived from integration with platforms that provide core utility in the healthcare, insurance, financial services and government sectors. Digital banking platforms, digital insurance platforms, electronic health record systems, chronic care management systems, practice management systems â€” all can benefit from a robust secure messaging and file exchange feature â€” and email encryption APIs deliver both a ubiquitous method of sending and receiving messages (and files) as a toolbar feature of the applicationâ€™s UI.Viewed thru this lens â€” the email encryption API is both an innovation and a disruption to the existing email encryption product status quo. There are dozens of companies offering email encryption as a subscription service, with very little differentiation, and frankly â€” very little end user love. Most solutions are burdened with cumbersome, multi-step processes either for the recipient, the sender, or both. It is a mature solution â€” most organizations that need it have a subscription (SaaS). It is a software solution that is ripe for disruption, and ready to be consumed as a feature instead of a separate product. Email encryption APIs can deliver that disruption â€” and yield a better tool for moving sensitive business communications and processes forward.Originally published at https://www.datamotion.com on October 28, 2019.----Experts on delivering electronic information in a cost effective, secure & compliant way.The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alex Mathers--220HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"
589,34718,https://medium.com/@list_7654/netflix-misses-on-subscribers-d78467c0092?source=tag_archive---------83-----------------------,Netflix misses on subscribers,None,Chris Waterman,https://medium.com/@list_7654,2,0,0,"Chris WatermanFollow--ListenShareNetflix reported earnings this week with the stock dropping over 10% following the results. Netflix reported only 2.7M new subscribers vs. a forecasted 5M, which sent the stock tumbling and caused concern amongst investors.Since 2016, Netflix has essentially reached or exceeded any new subscriber forecasts given, with it missing only a handful of times. This, however, is the largest miss the company has experienced.Netflix pointed to two major reasons for the new subscriber miss:â€œWe think Q2â€™s content slate drove less growth in paid net adds than we anticipated.â€ (Reed Hastings)Thereâ€™s no denying that Netflix needs more hits as competition begins to ramp up. Netflix has had a lot of success with shows such as House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Stranger Things, Making a Murderer and The Crown. These shows had and still have some draw for new subscribers to the service. But with the recent news that Netflix will lose both The Office and Friends from its service, Netflix must maintain its content library to remain a part of a consumerâ€™s subscription plan.Itâ€™s not all doom and gloom however. Whilst they did miss their forecast, the total percentage of domestic subscription misses by the total is marginal.And Netflix has demonstrated that theyâ€™re able to raise prices by 20% and keep growing. Thatâ€™s no small feat and any cable TV executive would be envious as it demonstrates Netflixâ€™s overall pricing power.Netflix is also redefining the benchmarks for streaming services and how investors measure success. As it leverages all of its data from the platform, itâ€™s demonstrating what it deems successful and convincing investors that these are the important metrics. No more evident is the recent Adam Sandler movie â€” with Netflix claiming that 73M households watched this film in its first four weeks. (Netflix defines a watch as reaching at least 70% of the content).Netflix raised prices to continue investing in its content production. But how much further could they raise prices and not begin to significantly churn customers? As competition intensifies, other services will compete on price and content to attract and retain consumers, and Netflix needs more blockbuster and viral hits to retain its position.ðŸ‘‰ If you enjoy reading this media, click here to sign up for my weekly newsletter on tech, media and trends.----Chris WatermaninDataDrivenInvestor--Chris WatermaninDataDrivenInvestor--Chris Waterman--Chris Waterman--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Bryan YeinBetter Humans--639Alex Mathers--220Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

Development has been a bit slow this past week due to some staff catching the cold thatâ€™s been going around. Not to worry though, we are back in business.The Real Life Referral System will work as follows.Scroll down for a visualization of a poster template.Thanks for joining with my referral link [@user]! #welcome #bittubersCheck out [@user]â€™s profile here: [referred userâ€™s profile link]Sign up with my #referral link here and earn a 500 XP sign-up bonus![referral link]Sounds complicated? Let us explain the benefits.At the end of the day, we think this is a pretty water-tight system. It might look convoluted at first, but each step is deliberately chosen to eliminate abuse and to maximize our return on investment in terms of exposure and engagement. In other words, new users arenâ€™t bought, they are earned.Additionally, it has been requested that we include an â€œafter the factâ€ referral window for new signups, in case they forgot to use a referral link from a friend and would like to claim the 500 XP afterwards. We think this is a good idea. We will review this feature after the referral system goes live. We will likely add this with a 30-day availability window after signup.Lastly, we are exploring a parallel â€˜premiumâ€™ referral system for paid members (Plus or higher membership). In this hypothetical system, users will receive a big XP bonus when using a button on your profile page as referral. You will then receive a substantial XP reward in case these users get a membership themselves, which will in turn lower your own membership fees significantly.It would be a mutually beneficial system to try to on-board more paid memberships.

Such a tendency stems from inefficiencies within the core operations that have a direct negative impact on the bottom lines of these firms. The complexity, related to the supply chain management, may be a major source of such inefficiencies.The two technological solutions allowing to overcome the complexity while also introducing transparency, are the Internet of Things (IoT) and the immune distributed ledger (blockchain). However, the degree of success from implementation of these tools depends on the ability of a company to ensure their natural assimilation and comprehensiveness.Supply Chain Management (SCM) commonly exhibits various types of issues, depending on a specific firm, industry, or even geographic location. The most common inefficiencies in SCM include:IoT and blockchain technology have proven their effectiveness in addressing the mentioned issues and risks.The IoT is a broad term that commonly implies a collection of interconnected physical devices allowing monitoring, reporting, and exchanging data. These devices connect to computer systems via Wi-Fi and data networks, creating a new form of the conceptual model. The devices commonly use sensors to measure geographic location, temperature, speed, humidity, light levels, and others. Smart devices, RFID chips, and mobile sensors are the common forms of IoT devices.When applied to the SCM, IoT resolves many core problems while enhancing a multitude of processes through its capabilities. The devices measure the geographic location of goods, preventing loss or theft. The measurement of speed allows forecasting a delivery more precisely while also limiting the safety-related risks. It is also possible to evaluate the storage conditions of goods that are particularly sensitive to them. The general streamlining of the processes enhances their administration while increasing flexibility of the firm.Blockchain represents a distributed ledger stored on multiple systems of various parties. The technology provides access to the data while supporting its storage and maintenance. Furthermore, blockchain technology supports data validation, allowing only authorized parties to append data blocks after confirmation from the other blockchain participants. The novel conceptual model prevents editing or deleting of data and demands the consensus among other parties.The strength of blockchain technology alone for SCM is already substantial. It addresses the concern of the extended value chains with large number of stakeholders. Commonly, the exchange of data between these parties is a complex and timely process because of mismatches in their individual ledgers. However, the implementation of blockchain technology on the internal and external levels would allow a company to streamline its business flows. Furthermore, it would enhance the speed and security by allowing different levels of access.The combined implementation of the IoT and blockchain significantly expands their benefits for the SCM. The possibilities are particularly significant for the automation of the main processes.In this scenario, the vendor would embrace full responsibility, as they would have access to the same data as the retail company. At the same time, both parties would be certain of data validity and authenticity. Furthermore, in case the indicators provided via the IoT device are in line with the smart contract specifications, the vendor would receive the payment in accordance with the predetermined terms.The simplicity and speed of the SCM process under the IoT and blockchain are significant benefits the firms utilizing them would gain in the short and long term. These benefits would form the conceptual model ensuring accessibility to information, automation of the core processes, connections between the physical and information flows, fraud detection and prevention.The strategic nature of the novel technologies, such as IoT and blockchain, combined with their immediate advantages following implementation, reflects their strong potential. These advantages are disruptive for the main stakeholders within the SCM process, namely the producer, freight forwarder, broker, and consumer. Blockchain is able to complement IoT in terms of security and audit procedures.The products developed on the basis of blockchain technology also ensure automation of the main processes. The automation reduces costs and time for the parties involved. In addition, the IoT and blockchain are able to remove ambiguity related to certain terms and conditions set within the agreement. In the end, the combination of the mentioned positive effects would grant any company an edge over its competitors failing to ensure technological development.Originally published at https://www.dewsolutions.in on August 16, 2019.----Dew SolutionsCore team member @ Dew Solutions (www.dewsolutions.in).

Block 1: Web Foundations is over!For those not in the know, Iâ€™m a student at Lambda Schoolâ€™s Full-Stack Web Development program (Read more here). In short, Lambda School is an online learning company offering 30-week programs in programming that are free until you get a job. If you donâ€™t get a job, they donâ€™t get paid.I do a write-up every single week about my experiences. If youâ€™re not caught up just yet, here are Part One, Part Two, Part Three, and Part Four.-> Click here for the original post <-This week, there were no lectures, no coding challenges, no instruction. It was finally time to put all our newly-learned skills to the test and build a full-blown project.Normally Lambda School students work in teams of approximately eight people. Students from the UX and Data Science cohorts will join forces with multiple Web students and together constitute a product team â€” Scrum master included. However, since weâ€™re the first EU cohort and timezones are a b*tch to deal with, we had a slightly different approach.Instead, we were asked to find a site template or landing page and replicate it to the best of our ability. Recreating Craigslist wasnâ€™t allowed, unfortunately. So, some of us hit up ColorLib and others decided to recreate the AirBnB or Stripe homepages. We collectively tried to find a theme that was both A.) challenging and B.) still doable with the skill set learnt in the previous four weeks.Iâ€™ve always been a big fan of ColorLibâ€™s BootStrap themes. Theyâ€™re really well-built and look great! With Bootstrap, I thought itâ€™d be a piece of cake! And then I found out we werenâ€™t allowed to use Bootstrapâ€¦Deciding to soldier on, I eventually settled on this theme and got to work.We had four days to complete the project and were free to add as much or as little functionality as you wanted. They practically threw down the gauntlet, telling us â€œImpress me.â€Frankly, most of us couldâ€™ve probably completed their projects in three days. Yeah, they donâ€™t kid around at Lambda.For most of us, our progress looked somewhat like this:The best part of the entire week? The post-finish 20-minute nap!And hereâ€™s the end result:At its core, itâ€™s just a basic startup homepage fit for any SaaS or subscription service. I just decided to have with it and create some modular components that can be reused through the entire site.It was definitely tricky to get all the positioning and styling just right â€” especially since a buffoon has more sense of design that I do. However, it all worked out quite well in the end. Everything works the way itâ€™s supposed to across a myriad of devices.To get a better idea of what Lambda students are capable of, one of my peers agreed to share their work.Maximeâ€™s (@MaximeSalomon) is from France and has quite a bit of experience with design â€” as youâ€™ll see. Not content with just doing the normal challenge like us mere mortals, he decided to up the ante a bit. He made a full-blown design in Sketch before ever typing a single line in code and decided to learn React on the fly by building the website and googling stuff as he went along.Yeah, he takes Lambda pretty seriously. The result speaks for itself.Long story short; Maximeâ€™s a baller.He went the extra mile, built an API entirely from scratch (!), got it up and running through Node and Express (Neither of which have been covered as part of the curriculum yet), and built his own CMS pretty much from scratch. He knows what heâ€™s doing! By the way, check him out on LinkedIn!Once again, all of this was made in less than four days by people whoâ€™d never coded before in their life before starting Lambda!Next week weâ€™ll be covering React. Luckily, I already feel pretty confident using it, so itâ€™ll be mostly filling in the gaps for me. As a precaution, though, Iâ€™m going to be reviewing all the materials in the learning kit ahead of time. In addition, Iâ€™ll be going over some of my notes from when I originally learned using it. Finally, Iâ€™ll be rereading Robin Wieruchâ€™s incredibly-comprehensive and easy-to-read book, â€˜The Road To Learn Reactâ€™.Iâ€™m currently in university, but thinking of dropping out/taking a semester off to do Lambda. Would you recommend it?Short answer: Maybe. Long answer: It depends on what you want to get out of it. If you want to get the hands-on experience and skill set to, letâ€™s say, launch a startup, it might be a good idea. Hell, by the end of Lambda, youâ€™re building fully-fledged MVPs, so you could launch one even before graduation. Also, it might be worth it if you want to add to whatever it is youâ€™re studying in college at the moment. This could mean a CS major getting some hands-on experience writing low-level code or a business major who wants to learn how to put his ideas into practice.However, keep in mind that you do have an Income-Share agreement you have to honour. Combining those with ever-higher student debt might be a tough financial pill to swallow.What has your experience been with the PM and instructors?There hasnâ€™t been a single instructor or TA who has said, â€œWell, that all the time I have, youâ€™re on your own!â€ They all stay late and help as long as you need it, often after hours or right through lunch. Even though they have other responsibilities and their own lives to attend to. Your peers will also help you wherever they can, which only shows how welcoming a place Lambda is.At one point, I was struggling how to â€˜undoâ€™ a Git Commit. Gabriel, our instructor, spent a good 30 minutes walking me through the different options you have to remove or redo a git commit, with the differences and respective benefits explained in great detail. He had no obligation to do so and Iâ€™m quite sure he couldâ€™ve used his time in more productive pursuits, but he still chose to help.Hell, last Friday he hosted a 4+ hour-long optional lecture on building a Tic Tac Toe game in React, just because he could. Most people at Lambda seem to cherish the opportunity to help those whoâ€™ve fallen between the cracks of the normal system. Itâ€™s a very brothers-in-arms type of deal.Howâ€™d you first learn of Lambda School?Austen Allredâ€™s Twitter (@Austen), which seems to be the biggest customer acquisition tool Lambda possesses at the moment.Build week was a great change of pace and really gave us the opportunity to show what we could do with our newfound skills. It also gave us a taste of what weâ€™ll be able to do by the end of Week 30.Next week is all about React. Finally. This is where the real fun begins. Rapid prototyping, being able to quickly throw together components. Itâ€™s a game-changer. Itâ€™ll be fun to see how Lambda will put us through the wringer next week. I canâ€™t wait.Finally, if youâ€™re interested in signing up for Lambda School yourself, please consider using this link. With it, youâ€™ll receive $250 after you attend your first day and Lambda will give me $250 for sending you there! Win-win!Remember, the average pace is for chumps!Until next week!----Anthony J.

597,7009,https://medium.com/@vooban/3-things-i-learned-at-the-cargo-logistics-canada-conference-321f69d8c545?source=tag_archive---------107-----------------------,3 Things I Learned at the Cargo Logistics Canada Conference,None,Vooban,https://medium.com/@vooban,5,1,"2, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*XrKovBDil_8h-jOQd0KhnA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*mvSi_kqWY82MppUJy4lm9g.jpeg","VoobanFollow--ListenShareDeep into Voobanâ€™s DNA, there was always a good dose of logistics and operations base application development. From the Defence consulting days of Kevin our President, the team at Vooban has often helped its partners to tackle complex logistics challenges and help optimize operation by removing bottleneck with better solutions and technology.Recently, we have been working very closely with some of the world-class maritime operators so we decided to jump on a plane to visit beautiful Vancouver and participate in the Cargo Logistics Canada conference.More than 2500 executives and professionals from the logistics industry gathered in the harbor to share challenges, ideas and visions to collectively help improve where Canada (and North America) is positioning itself in the global trade. Vooban was there to add its grain of salt by sharing what we have been doing around Terminal Operations, IoT, Telematics, and AI in this space.My first reaction when arriving at the event was how much of an outsider I was. I was entering a world where most people have been in it for most of their career (even life), knew the lingo and knew each other, partners, competitors, clients, all shaking â€” quite a refreshing site!For me, being such an outsider is my fuel! Having worked in many other industries in my career, I feel I can shake things up, bring a different point of view and also take some cues on how technology has been used elsewhere. Something we have been praised by our clients over the years. That being said, hereâ€™s what I learned at the Cargo Logistics Canada conference.1- A world that really MUST innovateIn the last years, innovation has been on everybodyâ€™s lips; in the tech world, in the banking and Insurance sphere, in the industry 4.0 and healthcare 2.0. I challenge you to find a slide deck without at least 5x the word â€œinnovationâ€ in it. But over the last 3 days, I realized that some sectors really have to look at innovation seriously, almost as a lifeline. The Cargo and Logistics sector, though not unique, is really â€œsqueezedâ€ by multiple factors where collaborative innovation is the principle solution on the horizon. They have to deal with:â€¢ Limited workforceâ€¢ Limited physical expansion possibility (limited land availability)â€¢ An exponential increase in demandâ€¢ Tighter regulations (related to land, water pollution, etc)â€¢ A major rethink of its business based on globalization and e-commerceâ€¢ Etcâ€¦So, in short, they have to do a LOT more with the same or even less they had 5 years ago.Voobanâ€™s mission revolves around technology, innovation, and rapid execution. This is how we have impacted our clients in the rapidly changing digital world. By helping our customers review their overall business processes, understand their main asset (data), define a short, medium- and long-term technology roadmap and lead its execution (proof of concepts, development and deployment/maintenance), we pride ourselves in having a real impact.2- Collaboration, Interoperability, the end of silosAbove, I mentioned collaborative innovation, and this was very obvious when exchanging with the leaders of the industry. They must sit down together and tackle very complex problems. There is NO passing the problems/challenges to the next player in the value chain here!This forces much better systems interoperability, referring to both engineering (physical) and technological systems.By taking an open architecture, microservice approach to our solution design, by deploying on secure cloud base infrastructure, by using self-healing and elastic tactics/technologies, we help our clients fulfill their activities but also bring their customers and partners further by providing better integration, better visibility, traceability, and data access.We also ensure that all solutions we develop exploits DevOpsâ€™ best practices and automated testing, to ensure quality, scalability, and performance.3- AI â€¦ where does it fit in all thisWhen looking at e-commerce and logistics, we often hear about the â€œlast mileâ€ challenge. Uber-like home delivery services, bicycle services in urban areas, in-truck delivery pilots, all new business models being played with, showing that lots of $ is at play. But over the last few days, I have opened my eyes to what many have referred to the â€œFirst mile challengesâ€ (though be it be much longer than a mile in this case). In dissecting this first mile, it is clear that technology, IoT and AI will play a key role.From cargo planning and optimization, rail and port planning, to forecasting and yield optimization, we are dealing with challenges that when data (often across multiple partners) is available, are well suited for AI, ML, and Deep Learning.When one of the main retailers is aiming to have a 1.2M sq.ft warehouse being managed by only 60 employees, it is clear that a LOT of tasks will have to be executed via automation and AI. The logistics world is a world of data so should be a domain that will see the earliest impact of AI if tackled rapidly.We often teach (or preach) to our clients the value of data, so we pride ourselves in the investments we have made over the last years around AI, by acquiring top talents, developing training for our team and recently even purchasing our own deep learning multi-GPU server. By developing AI ready solutions and by finding the best first projects in an AI roadmap for our partners, we are confident that we can accelerate this revolution while ensuring the best ROI.Positive Outlook for the Canadian economy To conclude, I want to thank the speakers and all the executives with whom I had a chance to chat during the event. When reading about all the work and investments being made, like the 3.5B$ in 2018 and forecasted 3.9B$ by the CN to improve its network, it is reassuring that visionaries are still at the helm to ensure that our economy strives in this rapidly changing world. As a smaller player, we pride ourselves in delivering value, helping transform organizations with technology that works and has an impact!----digital innovationVoobaninvooban AI--3Voobaninvooban AI--3Voobaninvooban AI--1VoobaninVooban - Histoires de dÃ©veloppeurs--The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Unbecoming--764Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Matt ChapmaninTowards Data Science--44Aleid ter WeelinBetter Advice--271Alex Mathers--220HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"

It is a branch of machine learning. The term deep learning comes from the way algorithms are designed to adapt and learn from information in a similar way deep neural networks in a humanâ€™s brain enable learning to happen.Many companies have used deep learning research to provide better products and service. Uber has been one of those companies actively working on deep learning models. According to Uber, this has been for a variety of reasons some of which include customer support, object detection, improving maps, and preventing fraud.To accomplish this, Uber has built and improved upon an already existing vast array of open source tools. Beginning in 2017 Uber released two new tools that enabled further deep learning research. One of which was Pyro, an open source probabilistic programming language. The other was Horovod, an AI tool that delegated the deep learning tasks throughout an array of different machines and GPUs. These both utilized currently existing open source libraries including TensorFlow, PyTorch, CNTK, MXNET, and Chainer.Uber is now announcing their next contribution to the open source deep learning toolbox with Ludwig. Ludwig is a deep learning program focused on making the process easier to understand for both, the in-experienced and experienced researchers. This is achieved through five design principles that are at the foundation of Ludwig.First is users can train a model and use it for predictions without coding. Second, the tool is usable across many different use cases through a principle called generality. The third is giving users extensive control over model building and training, in other words flexibility. Fourth is extensibility through the ease of adding new models and features. Last up is what Uber calls understandability, a principle that should allow users to visualize and perceive performance easier.Uber claims Ludwig can reduce hours of coding down to just a few minutes of work. Through an input as simple as a CSV file and Ludwigâ€™s easy to use encoder-decoder architecture, a wide array of machine learning tasks can be accomplished including text classification, object classification, image captioning, regression, and language modeling to name a few. In addition, several visualization options are available for when the results are collected.We are now in a time where machines can learn to solve complex problems without the help humans. Although this may sound scary, great strides can be made in technology through deep learning medicinal and pharmaceutical advances, virtual assistants, and an area Uber may be able to reap benefits from in the future: vision for driverless cars.----Cabe Atwell--3Cabe Atwell--1Cabe Atwell--2Cabe Atwell--1The PyCoachinArtificial Corner--343Alexander NguyeninLevel Up Coding--116Timothy MugayiinBetter Programming--92Molly RubyinTowards Data Science--126Matt ChapmaninTowards Data Science--44Somnath SinghinJavaScript in Plain English--267HelpStatusWritersBlogCareersPrivacyTermsAboutText to speech"
